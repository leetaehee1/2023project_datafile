"Denuvo Anti-Tampering makes the game stutter, same as every other game that adopts this cancer.",1
"Hogwarts Legacy is a very mediocre, generic and formulaic modern open world game that's saved from being a bad game by the Harry Potter license. They've done a good job of recreating Hogwarts and it is honestly really cool being able to fly around and above the castle on your broom seamlessly. I had fun in my first several hours playing the game just exploring the castle and the areas outside around the castle like hogsmeade. The more you progress though the more you realise how little the game has to offer. One of the biggest offenders is how lifeless the world feels with the lack of interaction in general. I compare it to Bully which came out 17 years ago now. When you walk around the school in Bully it feels like you are a part of that world. There is a time mechanic where you need to get to class on time and go to bed on time etc. All the NPC's have their routine they're following making you feel like the world is moving regardless of you being there rather than it feeling like the world is waiting for you like it does in Hogwarts Legacy. The difference between the level of interaction compared to a game released in 2006 is honestly really sad but that's just one of my many complaints. The general lack of role playing is also a big issue, you don't feel like a student in this world at all. You go to class like less than a dozen times from what i recall just to learn spells so you can go on mass killings in the world. The story and writing in general is lackluster, lack of well written characters to latch on to and connect with to pull you through the story. Main character has no personality. No consequences for your actions and choices have zero impact on the outcome in the end. Combat gets extremely repetitive and tiresome. The R2/RT spam is ridiculous i felt like i was on autopilot throughout most of the combat. The lack of enemy variety didn't help either. The gear system is terrible because of the level scaling making exploration pointless knowing you will never find a really good item that will last you dozens of hours because everything is scaled to your level. There is nothing interesting to see outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade because of all the bland check list side activities they've added to pad out the length. Boring level and puzzle design in the caves and dungeons. UI feels like it's ripped straight out of a modern Ubisoft game. Graphics are inconsistent, sometimes it looks like a good looking PS4 game and other times it looks like an early PS3 game. The performance is awful because of the amount of VRAM it uses, i had to find a fix online for my RTX 3070 8gb because it ate all my VRAM like it was nothing. Maybe it's justified if the game looked amazing but it doesn't. The game overall doesn't feel like it's a full price Triple A game, it feels like a budget title. Makes sense that the developers last game was Cars 3. 4/10 (Mediocre)",1
Great so far minus combat. This is dogshit,1
"Tedious, slow, presumptuous, patronising and dull.",1
please fix stuttering and FPS drop my pc system have above requirement but can't play this game with 60 fps,1
"got in to a spiders cave and fell from a cliff, now my entire game got stuck mid air. It acts like i am with the mouse on an image, no reaction, I've hit all the buttons from my keyboard to get a move.From a to z and f1 to f12 not a single button got me unstuck.I am currently removing the game. Hoping uninstall/install will solve the issue.",1
"all it does is crash.i try optimizing my settings, crashes.i try reinstalling, crashes.i try verifying files, crashes.turn off ray tracing, crashes.turn off other options, crashes.reduce from ultra to low, crashes.my recommended settings are ultra everything and everything on. my pc can play it, but the game just crashes.i play 2 minutes, crashes.i play 10 minutes, crashes.crashes, crashes, crashes.will update with recommend if the game gets fixed so i'm not crashing every time i try to play.",1
Latest update added lag to the game,1
"Awful stuttering, borderline unplayable until fixed. Will remove review when this eventually happensRTX 3060, Ryzan 7 5700G, 16GB DDR4 ram",1
A very pretty game but shallow in execution,1
"Performance is horrible, optimization was clearly not on the minds of the developers, a shame. Everything about this game is wonderful but just given the performance I cannot in good faith recommend this product. Refunded. Buy it on a console if you have the next-gen hardware, it's gonna save you a ton of headaches, mods aren't worth it here.",1
"Massive performance issue, needs patch - frequent fps drop to single digits and 20s. Good game otherwise",1

"Lets start with the pros:- Hogwarts itself looks great, at times I felt like I was in a Harry Potter movie- Music is decent, they remixed the classic HP tunes- Graphics are decent to great- Voice acting is pretty goodBut unfortunately once you look past the surface, a lot of problems start to appear. Unless youre a blind fanboy. One of the biggest issue if not the biggest is the empty open world littered with completely pointless stuff like Merlin's Trials, Treasure Vaults etc. Stuff straight out of Ubisoft's book for ""How to Pad Your Game's Length"".It would be alright if for example the Merlin's Trials were like 8 trials total, all wildly different. Merlin's Trials are simple puzzles you have to complete in droves to unlock more of your very limited inventory space. After you've done 3 different Trials, you've done them all. Unfortunately there are over 90 of these goddamn trials.Treasure Vaults are like Merlin's Trials but even simpler and and the reward is opening a door in to a tiny ""dungeon"" (and I mean tiny, takes 5 seconds to reach the loot) where one piece of loot awaits you, usually just something trash (its all randomized so you can even savescum before opening any container)And there's tons of these, just littered everywhere. And you cant turn them off. When youre flying on your broom and press R to reveal nearby interesting locations, a huge mass of these icons pops up in your face and you just want to quit playing.Side quests are nearly all simple fetch quests, some dont even bother hiding it. I just currently got a literal fetch quest where I have to make a delivery in a far away place. I know I wont finish this quest.There are over 150 so called ""field guide pages"" to collect in Hogwarts alone. These net you XP which is needed to level up. 90% of the content in this game is Ubisoft style completely pointless garbage. And I really mean around 90%. 5% is fetch quests and actual good content is the remaining 5%, the main quests which are actually fun to play.Forget about anything interesting happening anywhere, the NPC's are all just as soulless as for example in Cyberpunk. There is no AI whatsoever. Forget even about stuff like for example in Witcher 3, where even small bandit hideout location often had a bit of attached lore in the form of a diary of their latest victim etc, just fleshing out the world. None of that here.I'm 17 hours in and I just have no interest playing anymore, its very formulaic, very tiresome, and apart from the occasional fun main questing, overwhelming majority of the content is braindead boring. And I didn't even mention the performance issues. They can fix the performance but they wont fix the game design choices made.",1

As a transgender this game is very offensive.,1
"Hogwarts Legacy will be the most overhyped and also the most boring game of the year.The immersion and role playing elements are absolute trash, I never once felt like a student as hogwarts as I was always wearing some goofy ass costume due to my gear. There is little to no interaction between mc and the other students and there are no minigames to play with them either. MC is a complete teachers pet regardless of what you want your character to be like and in that aspect it makes sense that the other students ignore you. There are zero consequences for your actions, so you can't be whatever you want to be as the story is set in stone, you can't fail anything either. You can use unforgivable curses as much as you want and nobody will give a shit.The progression in the game is also horrible. Around a third of the way into the game you unlock the ability to unlock locks and what you unlock is tier 1 of 3. Exploring before being able to unlock tier 3 locks is a waste of time as you'd have to backtrack just to get that one tier 3 lock. Gearing doesn't really matter at all and you just smack on whatever has the highest stats, you don't even need to upgrade any gear ever, the only thing gearing really does is make you look like a clown. There is a fashion system so you can change appearance to not look like a clown, but it resets whenever you equip new gear, so you might as well just stay as a clown. The game tells you that you start unlocking talent points from level 5, but you can't unlock a single talent before you're well over level 10. The talent points themselves are mostly useless due to the combat being extremely easy and the only good talent is increasing revelio range as you're spamming revelio constantly during your entire playthrough.The open world offers nothing interesting to do. There are a ton of merlin chores to increase your gear slots, but none of these offer any kind of challenge. I usually enjoy platforming, but the merlin chore platforming trial consists of jumping from one massive block to another that is right next to the other, they are impossible to fail. It's just so incredibly boring. There are also a bunch of caves and treasure vaults, but most of the time they are as follows; run down a passage and loot 1 chest. Good job you've cleared a cave. Some time you actually have to open the cave or treasure vault in some way, but as long as you have at least one active brain cell this is very doable. On extremely rare ocassions there is something you have to do in the cave to get your one chest, but as long as that one brain cell is still active you'll manage. On even rarer occassions you might encounter an enemy in a cave (OMG) which you'll destroy in a second, what a challenge. There are some other activities in the open world like you can pop 5 balloons in a row on your broom, this is so engaging and fun. There are even landing platforms you can land on and that's about it. The combat is dreadfully easy, you are playing with cheats as your aimbot is turned on probably as it was developed for consoles. You can aim normally, but then the game zooms in so the back of your head covers half the screen. The lock-on targeting system for PC is garbage as the way you switch targets is with the arrow keys, so never lock-on to an enemy, you have aimbot anyway. The enemy never dodges any of your spells either so feel free to massacre them. The enemy AI is really bad as well which makes an easy game even easier, the best example are the dugbogs which routinely gets stuck which means you can spam them down without them even moving. However the game should get some praise now and this is related to some mechanics of different enemy types like how you can use flipendo on the club of a troll after it has swung at you to flip it into its face, these kinds of things kept the combat from being completely boring. The secrets and puzzles of this game were not challenging at all for the most part. For example one of the hogwarts secrets are light 4 braziers on a bridge and then match the symbols. Whoever was in charge of designing the puzzles must have been designing this for toddlers. However I will give praise to one single thing related to puzzles and that is the depulso puzzle rooms as they were the only fun puzzles to do in this game albeit a bit short. The by far best part of this game is the room of requirement which will appeal to people that like making houses in the sims. The room of requirement also have up to 4 vivariums unlocked through story progression which can hold the beasts you capture. The game should also get a bonus for having very good shiny rates for the beasts as I don't think many would have wanted Pokemon levels of shiny rates for the beasts in this game.There's no quidditch in this game which is understandable, but instead it was replaced with broom races. You are challenge by some arrogant asshole named Imelda to beat her times. To describe how easy she is to beat, you can start the race, then go make dinner, eat your dinner, take a shit and then come back to still be faster than her. She is supposed to be the fastest racer at Hogwarts, but after leaving her in the dust you can check the leaderboards for the race and she's nowhere to be found. The leaderboard times are not very difficult to beat either which is disappointing. I was hoping there was more broom races, but there are only 3.-Spoilers ahead-As is very common now the story is set in stone, none of your choices have any impact whatsoever. Towards the end of the story two of the main antagonists have a falling out and one of these confronts you and offer you to work together with him to take down the main antagonists. Personally I would have liked to be able to accept this offer, but instead MC is dumb and wants to kill him instead. There are technically two endings, but they are extremely similar and the ending is decided by drum roll... dialogue options before final boss fight. Nothing really matters and that is extremely evident throughout the game. The characters are also really shallow, but then again we don't really interact much with any of the characters.If you want to play a game set in the Harry Potter universe I'd rather recommend the older Harry Potter games as they are far more engaging and challenging.",1
"To be clear, I'm not leaving a negative review because of the recent controversy. I couldn't give a damn about JK Rowling's opinions or how others have chosen to interpret them.In truth, I want to recommend this game. I want to recommend it so much, just for its merits in gameplay and design, but I can't. I can't because the game is sadly suffering from poor optimisations and serious stuttering. I know its not cutting-edge hardware, but an RTX 3080 should be able to handle it on high settings at the very least, yet I have to tone the settings to mostly medium just to get a playable framerate.What really drives the point home is that this game actually runs better on the steam deck. Some are blaming Denuvo DRM for the poor performance, but until the game runs smoothly (whether it be because Denuvo is patched out of the game or the game is optimised to run smoothly even with Denuvo attached), this is where my review will end.",1
"Do NOT buy unless you at least meet the RECOMMENDED requirements! Unfortunately the specs given for this game are pretty misleading. I have a GTX 1050 ti, and I meet all the other requirements for the game. This meets the minimum requirements but not the recommended. I have had nothing but trouble getting this game to work. I have read that other people who have much better hardware than me also have this problem so I'm not sure if it's the game or my hardware. I can run the game on low, but even then there are fps stutters and texture popping. I was content to play like this until this morning, I booted up the game and now it's unplayable with major graphics issues, and audio stutter. At this point I have spent so much time getting this game to work, I'm ready to give up. Maybe I'll try again after some patches come out and my patience for the whole thing has reset.",1
Can't even start this POS. Constant crashes...,1
There are a lot of bugs right now. It keeps shutting off and now wont open at all.,1
"the pc performance is pretty horrible, even with rtx 3080ti, running the global graphical setting at ""High"" the framerate will drop to 30 to 40 fps here and there most of the time. it feels like a good game within my limited 3 hrs of gameplay, but it's impossible to overlook the extremely poor pc performance.",1
"In my opinion, this just doesn't share the same magic as the books or the movies, and it falls flat in comparison to other open-world RPG adventures I have enjoyed. I think the core issue is that the player protagonist doesn't have much personality, and that limited what they could do with the storytelling and immersion. This game was safely designed and well marketed, but has since fallen off the radar in a market well supplied with punchy and innovative offerings launching every week.",1
Kind of boring,1
"I couldn't even judge the game itself. For those that can play it, it probably is good. But for us that crash like harrys broom into the whoomping willow... well",1
"Overall It's an alright game.It's objectively not a great RPG tho.I'd recommend it for harry potter fans but if you expect a fully fledged RPG, try something else.This will be a no recommendation until they fix the performance issues tho.",1
"After 30 hours of play time, I feel ready for this review. At first, this game is amazing. The world Avalanche built is incredible, Hogwarts is just perfect. As a Harry Potter fan, I read all the books when I was a kid and being able to explore Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest and everything else is awesome. That said... Let's talk about real gameplay.This game does not trully rewards exploration. AT ALL. Let's be honest... going through dungeons or puzzles to get to the end and be like ""oh cool, my scarf now can be blue."" or ""ANOTHER DAMN UGLY GLASSES THAT I WON'T USE. THANKS"" is frustrating. So after a while I just gave up on exploring because it feel like wasted time.Do you really expect me to go all the trouble of that many collectibles to get a robe color? Or a broom appearance? Nope.The AI is DUMB. Despite the combat looking much better than I expected, after a few hours it feels a LOT repetitive. It is not really challengin: just find a combo you like, keep pressing R2 and looking at your char to know when to press dodge or block. I mean... every fight feels exactly the same. It is boring. There are no different strategies that really matter.Honestly... at this point, I'm just going to burn through the story and hope to see the end of this.",1
"Avoid, still plenty of bugs and now my game is stuck on loading screen...",1
shit game waste of money,1
"Ancient magic of EVADE ROLL and 'PRESS x TO KILL'Immersive experience of SOCIETY WE LIVE IN TODAY (twitter edition)Cutting edge technology of MEDIUM-LOW AND SLOW on 3060Ti (artifacts included)Revealing history of Hogwarts THAT DOES NOT MATCH ITS PRESENTGroundbreaking gameplay of SPINNING WORLD GLOBES, PETTING THE CATS and PILFERING PRIVATE PROPERTY in plain sightIngenious wand combat system right from PIANO CLASSES, and WOW COOLDOWN MANAGEMENTA single player experience WITH 'A MOUNT AND A HAT' DLC FOR 20 EUROS ON TOPI could go on like this for a long time... But I actually do not see any reason to spend that much time. My review is one  in tens of thousands, no one will evem ever read this.I could say that most of the the game is well made. But the fact is that the most of the actual GAME game is NOT well made. What's really well made, is 3D decorations of Hogwarts itsef, surrounding areas and other visual stuff. But the most of the actual game mechanics feel clunky and look like a list of missed oportunities, and NOT immersive at all. And still, I see a lot of 'Positive' reviews that only run through the things they 'don't like' and still say 'yes I recommend'. Like, people. Come on. Be honest!And the most important lesson here would be: Harry Potter and Dark Souls just do not mix well.",1
"What the hell you did to that game?First few days very nice graphics, smooth running, revelio here revelio there....And then after some update everything looks like when you wake up after 5 days weekend in different city still on drugs.Polishing details are missing, textures are fked up, everything looks like the graphics did not render completely.Utter rubbish.And it was working very good before.What have you done...",1
Too many tech issues.  Save your money until the game has been finished.,1
"Just so slow and boring. Hardest difficulty doesn't pose a challenge. I force myself to play it in hopes of SOMETHING to get me happy about it.Oh yeah don't forget the fucking platforms, shit repetetive level design. And when the combat is actually satisfying, give a total of 10 minutes of it. Useless boring game that looks good.",1
Great game but it keeps crashing.I've tried to grin and bear it but with my drivers updated and hardware that's definitely up to the task...it's not good enough when i've paid almost sixty quid on a game,1
"Less Game play , more Of cutsense, maybe rather than making a game, you guys should have made a netflix series.",1
Game was Absolutely amazing... until it deleted my save,1
A lot of effort went into making this game look great but not much went into the actual gameplay itself.  I was hooked for the first 10 hours or so and then it became a shallow slog.  This is not a bad game just disappointing and mediocre.  For generic combat/looting/idle mechanics with a Hogwarts skin look no further.  If you want to actually roleplay a hogwarts student rather being forced into the role of a psychopathic murderous spell caster then this is not the game.I wish Steam allowed partial refunds for pricey games like this that put in just enough effort to get you well past the 2 hour window before revealing their shallowness.,1
"As someone who enjoys the Harry Potter movies but isn't necessarily a die-hard fan, I was excited to try out ""Hogwarts Legacy"" after hearing rave reviews from my friend who is a Potterhead. I went all-in and purchased the deluxe edition, eager to explore the stunning and immersive world that awaited me.And I wasn't disappointed - the game truly is a visual marvel, with so much to discover and do. Whether you enjoy puzzles, collecting fantastic beasts (which are essentially the game's version of Pok?mon), or unraveling mysteries, there's always something new to keep you engaged.After completing the main mission, though, I found myself feeling somewhat unsatisfied. The characters' side stories felt confusing, and I'm not sure whether it was because of the choices I made or something else, but the outcome didn't seem to make sense within the larger narrative. It was as if the game had already predetermined an ending that didn't quite fit.In addition, there were some performance issues with raytracing, even though I have an RTX 3080 that should be able to handle any raytracing game with ease at 1440p. I was able to find mods that helped to alleviate this problem, but it was still disappointing to encounter these issues in the first place.As such, while ""Hogwarts Legacy"" certainly has its moments, I don't feel comfortable recommending it at this time. And especially considering the standard edition's hefty price tag of ¢æ60, it's hard to justify spending that much money on a game that comes with performance issues that players may need to fix on their own.",1
"I really wanted to love this game, and it's not bad at all, but there is too much bad gamedesign to make it a great game. If you want an atmospheric game its a 10/10 (if you somehow manage to run it at max settings) Its the gameplay where it falls short! Tedious grinding in a singleplayer game, to enable you to to more tedious and boring gameplay, is just bad gamedesign! The game seems littered with content, but once you scratch the surfuce you will find out just how much of the same bs is duplicated and thrown out all over the place..Ex. trials of merlin could have been a more fleshed out side-quest with 5-10 interesting puzzles in series, and would unlock some appearances or something in the line of that. instead you have to do boring grinding, just to not be pestered with a full inventory of gear every 5 min, its just bad gamedesign! !spoiler! And if that isnt enough, the game wont let you finish the game without you giving in to all the grind! V E R Y bad gamedesign! The bad game design makes the game land on a overall (4/10) score, its that bad gamedesign! very sad!",1
"So I've been on the fence with this game since release. I have played a fair amount, but at the moment this seems to be driven almost by compulsion than enjoyment. The world is beautiful, yet there isn't a lot in it. The phrase 'wide as an ocean, shallow as puddle' applies perfectly here which shows what a trap an open world can be for a video game. What there is to do in the world consists mostly of go to a location marked on the map, go down a short corridor or tunnel, find a chest, and you're done. Sometimes there's a very simple puzzle before the chest can be reached or perhaps instead of a chest it is some other macguffin. More infuriating is the rewards from these chests are either tiny amounts of currency or randomised gear which quickly becomes useless except to sell for small amounts of currency you don't need because everything was purchased long ago.The story itself is confused and nonsensical. Who is our character? Why did they start late? Do they have family? No idea! Could be an orphan or a particularly angsty teenager. Maybe they're muggleborn. For such a seemingly important person who even the Ministry has taken an interest in, no one seems to care where you came from. So much just happens in this story for no reason, and even the characters sometimes take a double-take. At one point your character even says 'At this point, I've just learned to go along with it.' when explaining the story thus far to another character. Writers: if you feel your character in universe would say this, your writing is bad. I haven't completed the game and am uncertain if I will, but I doubt some sudden revelation will fix the story.This also isn't a game about being a Hogwarts student. If anything, the game is embarrassed that it is set in a school in the first place. You participate in 3.5 classes, though these consist of doing one activity and then a cutscene. After that, every other class is simply a cutscene. Instead you'll do assignments which often don't have anything to do with the spell you'll learn, and then your Divination teacher will teach you a defensive spell for some reason. Hilariously, the best integration of assignments with spell learning is when the Hogwarts caretaker who is supposed to be in charge of student discipline teaches you how to break and enter and then proceeds to tell you to do it all over the game world. The game actively encourages criminality as well since finding items for your little hub are usually hidden in other people's homes behind locks. You'll spend far more time in Argyllshire looting said homes than you will in school, though evidently the classes are taking place off screen since teachers will endlessly comment on how well you are doing. Am I doing well? Weird, I haven't been inside these walls since September, but look at these fancy, contemporary clothes I just dug out of a 500-year-old-tomb. Was super easy as the door was open, and all I had to do was walk down a corridor, take a left, and there was the chest. Fashion sure hasn't changed much in 500 years, eh?As I said, it is a beautiful world, and Hogwarts is realised in painstaking detail. It's just a shame that optimisation seems to have been ignored. Even on a fairly beefy rig, the framerate can suddenly crawl. This is annoying normally, but in fights it becomes infuriating as your inputs won't be recognised in time to block or dodge attacks. Some enemies cause this all the time such as trolls. It's also a frequent occurrence to simply fall through the game map, but thankfully you can hop on your broom and fly back up through the ground.I'd say in short this game needed months back in oven, and I really wish they had actually tried to capture the setting of the books, that is: a student going to a magical school. Even a curfew could have been fun done well, and why were house points taken away? It's not bad as a scenic journey through the countryside, a walking tour of Hogwarts, or possibly if you are itching to murder many hundreds of faceless witches and wizards as a 15-year-old. As an RPG though it fails pretty miserably and plays a lot like an MMO, just in single player.",1
"It's marketed as an open-world RPG but it's really not. Exploration is highly repetitive and the combat/gear/progression systems are not well-designed. There's also not much room for personalisation, no morality system and none of the dialogue choices actually matter, so as a result you can't really relate much with the main character throughout. In a nutshell, it delivers the basics of what is expected of a game set in the HP universe, but there's a lot of wasted potential as an open world RPG. If there's going to be a sequel to this, I hope it can be developed by a studio who's more experienced in designing RPGs.",1
"0/10I spent 6 hours troubleshooting this game and I've not once been able to play it despite my ""32 minutes of Playtime"". I've tried every work around and I can't even play. I've played free games that had less issues, Star Citizen and Cyberpunk 2077 ran 100x better and I could actually play. Warner Bros. should pay people to play because this was not worth the $60 spent on this. What a waste of time.",1

"A game of missed opportunities. Aside that it runs poorly, there are some REALLY disappointing game mechanics:1. There is nothing to do in Hogwarts and the game constantly gives you quests to go explore the outside world.2. The room of requirement: I would gladly go to the potion classroom and the greenhouse to brew potions and plant plants. Same goes for the pets. Room of Requirement should have been a place to practice your spells or just a room that you can decorate/upgrade your equipment/etc.3. You can't sell potions or plants. Why is finding ugly equipment the only way of making gold in game?4. Most common thing you get as a reward is (mostly) ugly looking piece of equipment to no end.5. You buy ALL potions recipes from Hogsmeade. What is potion professor for? - to teach you spells LOL6. Why can't I buy things at Zonko's AND USE THEM IN COMBAT or to troll my classmates/professors? 7. Why can't I buy things at Honeydukes and use them to replenish my HP? Or even gift them as presents to to other ppl or just buy them to waste my gold.8. Really? No Quidditch and it is because the headmaster sucks? Really?9. Enemies: Humans, trolls, spiders and inferi. Good job.10. What is the point of locked doors if there are 10 more locked doors after it. SO ANNOYING. Can you please make the Alohomora 3 an instant unlock?11. I think I could have designed better staircase. 12. Ghosts and portraits are almost non interactable with.13. There is no points collection rewards. I think it would be fun if instead of having a non meaningful scene of you attending the class, YOU actually attending the class, prof asking questions and if you answer them correctly, you get points. This knowledge could be obtained from chests, ghosts and other things for example instead of just rewarding ugly meaningless equipment.14. I wish I could have an ACTUAL relationship meters where I can do quests for professors, different houses and local folk. Would be amazing if as I advance the relationships I get lore, I am able to visit other house rooms and get different quests if I decide to advance them (instead of everything being offered).15. HUD sucks. I don't need a million markers on my map nor (ugly yellow pixelated) quest indicators. I JUST NEED A COMPASS. Maybe instead of marking everything on the map, after advancing a certain quest, through conversation with NPC you would get locations of near places of interest. I am sure that there will be more disappointing things as I advance in the game, but so far I am finding more things that I am disappointed about than amazed with.Hogwarts is beautifully designed and there are some really neat easter eggs and somewhat challenging puzzles that aren't obvious and need a min or two to think about. But the rest is just repetitive and not challenging at all. I see no reason why they would waste time on making a large map with random villages instead of making Hogwarts a main place of exploration.",1
Game doesnt even load past shaders gets stuck my total trime played has been spent on a screen warning me of seizures or trying to load shaders on a bar that doesnt move,1
"This game has amazing visuals and the combat system is pretty good too. But this game is sold as a RPG and it has no RPG elements. You don't have choices in this game and you can't be a particular wizard either. Instead you're a wonderboy perfect, can do everything wizard that is always cheery and respectful.Oh, and how did they make learning new spells fun? Every time you're ready to learn a new spell you have to complete the most boring assignments to learn it. Either it is doing some combat feats or drinking multiple potions at the same time, throwing out some plants at the same time. It's so freaking tedious!And also what's up with the menu design? Navigate with a freaking pointer while its much faster to just press up or down. No sell all button while you have sell a LOT of gear.Yeah, they shower you with meaningless gear in this game, probably 99% of my play time was spent just changing gear for a green that is better then a legendary 4 drops later.There's more but fuck listing everything. Also to be fair, good music and voice acting, although the voice acting doesn't really have to push itself when it comes to emotion.",1
"From 120 fps to 10-20? Ok, np",1
A little boring...in battle.,1
"Glorified Ubisoft game with harry potter reskin. Doesn't help that the game has been trying to go politically correct that totally breaks immersion. Your character is basically a ""Yes sir"" or a ""Slightly moody teenager."" Economy seems totally busted, with at it's core either a ""poacher sim"" or a ""sell my 1000th useless loot."" RPG elements in the game don't really go far, with using ""unforgivable curses"" having NO repercussions whatsoever to your character in game story wise. Suffers alot from Cyberpunk 2077's ""beautiful set piece but a boring game."" The stuttering and frame drops also definitely DO NOT help this game at all (for reference im playing with a 3070 and still getting huge stuttering in 1080p or 1440p)...Main story introduces you to an antagonist, that seems ""strong"" and is trying to get to a power that the player is also trying to reach. But it doesn't really explain the stakes at hand at all? Vague asf and ultimately not that interesting. Can't believe i stopped playing elden ring for this.",1
"This is the shittiest PC port I have ever played. The stuttering I experience even after the patch renders the game completely unplayable. Character faces and expressions are lifeless, and the whole world is soulless. The attempt at making an inclusive character creator is lackluster at best, and insulting at worst. There are still clearly two stereotypical gender expressions. Sure you can mix and match feminine/masculine voices with a masculine/feminine body and title (witch/wizard), but there are still only two of each, clearly meant to correspond with the cis normative gender dichotomy. The token trans character is a joke, and feels like a derogatory pity party. Seriously, don't buy this game, it's unplayable and clearly not ready for release. I would have gotten a refund, but I spent over two hours trying to fix this pile of human waste, so I might finish the game if it gets fixed. Still not worth buying this lifeless mess. If you want to buy this game regardless of your money going to the genocide of trans people, get some help.",1

"My recommendation: Just watch a ''Hogwarts Legacy All Cutscenes/Full Movie' video. Not worth playing.Quite a forgettable experience.Bought it on the HP hype, should have watched a few hours of a let's play video, to realize this just isn't a 2023 RPG.",1
lost all game progression after 39 hours,1
"This game breaks immersion everytime I get immersed into it, the game runs like shit the characters are unlikable and I blieve that this game is overhyped.",1
"I have spent 20 hours on this game and it has reset my progress twice im so fucking done. The first time i thought it might've just been because i forgot to save or smth and i wasnt that far in so i decided to just restart. The second time, i remember saving and when i try to load a game, there's nothing there. I can't even get a refund because ive played 20 hours and now have no motivation to play it all again.",1
"How to play Hogwarts Legacy:1. Stop looking at negative reviews. 2. Completely ignore the pointless agenda-driven controversy from both sides, you are not hurting anyone, you are not endorsing anything.3. Steal 40$ from your mom.4. Purchase and play the game.5. Enjoy.",1
Horrible on AMD Software. constant crashes and no way around it.Im sure its a great game but practically unplayable for the percentage of the population that plays on AMD.My Specs are: AMD Ryzen 3 3100 4 Core Processor 16GB RAM AMD 6600 XT GPUWaste of $70 Thank you Avalanche,1
There are too many game-breaking bugs to recommend buying this game at this time. There are currently a number of bugs which prevent progressing the main quest line.,1
"The game constantly crashes my PC, makes the PC restart, this only happens when playing on this game.Have changed dll files for dlss changed resolution, switched off raytracing and configured my 3090 GPU. Updated windows, drivers but still crashy. Other than that pretty fun game, shame it's giving me a bad time.",1
"Stunning visuals, great music and very detailed environment for HP fans. Combat and gameplay is not that bad either. But story, dialogues and writing in general is horrible. Both very short and uninteresting. I don't know who decided that this game is an RPG but this is not RPG.",1
"Just not worth the money. If it's half the price, then yeah go ahead and play and enjoy it for what it is. Nothing in this game is done wholeheartedly. Everything from story to beasts to game play to optimization is like 30-50% of what it should be to push it up to next level. Nothing is done to it's full extent. The UI for PC is complete garbage, scrolling through spell sets that can only have 4 spells at a time is so bad for game play. Probably biggest annoyance.",1
"Runs like shit, quite dialogue heavy - wait for patches / sale",1

3080 10gb with a 3600 and 32 gigs of 3200 mhz ram and Game will be fine at 75 fps and then tank to 2fps and stay there. Sometimes it works for and hour or so and sometimes it works for 30 seconds.,1
"endless update, can't play",1
"The game overall is very beautiful, But between the many problems that exist and can be easily fixed, such as broom camera locking, frantically searching for revelio pages with little success, and the very basic facial details on npc, maybe hold off on buying it until they give it a good polish",1
After patch. Take more than a minute to load the map each time you fast travels. Constantly FPS drop makes the game unplayable.,1
game is goodbut after patch that came after feb 15th game become unplayable,1
"Game looks absolutely amazing, but it just does not work on pc as of right now, unless youre running a nasa kinda rig. It stutters, drops frames even in cut scenes and crashes the moment you even think of blinking. Its like RD2 but about a thousand times worse. Whoever greenlit this game for release on pc in this condition should be fired. Loving the game but this needs a patch ASAP. Should be illegal to charge money for a game as unstable as this. (R7 3700x, asus tuf rtx 3070 OC, 16gb ram, 1tb nvme storage)",1
"Amazing visual quality and design of the Hogwarts and the world. Quite nice combat. Poor everything else. Repetitive chest grind, mind-numbing boring quests, identical NPCs, no dialogue options, no plot options. Glorified Visual Novel or worse.",1
"I have a 1080Ti and 16 GB RAM. I am very meticulous in keeping my RAM usage low as well. When this game is running, I am using 80% of my RAM on average and it shows. The game does not run well at all. Setting everything to low made it playable, but still jarring with frame drops and assets taking centuries to render already scaled down textures. I have seen other reviews from people similar specs saying they have no issue, so take it as you will. It was fine enough for long enough that I did not request a refund within Steams policy time, so I played it anyways. Do not take my hours played as an endorsement for the game. I would absolutely not buy it right now unless you have considerably higher specs, as players with similar ones to mine are giving mixed reviews. However, if the performance issues are resolved, I highly recommend purchasing it then or purchasing it for console if you must have it right now. It really is a great game and I will change my review to positive if they fix these issues.",1
When the game loads it is beautiful and a great experience. But of the 10 times I have tried to load the game I have only gotten past the shader screen once. The game continues to crash while loading the shaders and it is extremely frustrating.,1
Boring and repetitive. Obviously mainly for kids. But not that exciting. Great story line but I skip all of the cut scenes because they take so long. The map is empty and there really isnt much to do. The game stutters at times but I will say it is beautiful. But I feel like they should have took more time with it...you cant even keep gear because you fill up quick and having a house is pointless because there is nothing special about it - you cant use your bed and there really is nothing special about day/night. Honestly nothing special about the game in general.,1
"could be a good game, if the thing ever opened, i have a brand new pc with very high specs and the game wont open, will force my pc to crash on the loading screen. absolute trash on the developers end of quality control.",1

"[b] It's not great. If anything, it's somewhat mediocre. I'll personally give it a 7/10 but only for its beautifully crafted world and nothing more. I absolutely love flying on a bloom and take in the scenery from above the skies. The gameplay and story however are just below average. [/b][b]The Open world[/b]Beautifully crafted. Absolutely uninspiring mobile game tier of contents scattered around the maps though.I like the field guide page mechanics, it adds more lore reading to the Harry Potter universe and adds value to the exploration.Having 60 random chests just laying around all over some random corridors in Hogwarts however is quite immersion breaking. Needlessly to say it feels wrong having to break into every single houses in the world just to collect the collectibles. This is not what I anticipates from a ""Hogwarts wizard RP game"" experience.Hundreds of Merlin trials of the exact same 5 puzzles? Caves that lead to a chest that gives you ¡¦ 16 gold? Not to mention all the doors and chest gatekeeped by random locks, requiring you to suck it up to Gladwin and hunt down moon statutes for 6 hours just to learn Alohomora. The contents in the open world gets old fast, and within minutes you¡¯ll find yourself quickly unmotivated to touch any of them. And the worst thing is the game punishes you for not doing that. Upon starting the game the first thing they tell you is that combat don't give XP, but only completing achievements does. So you HAVE to do these tedious mobile game grinds to keep up with the ever increasing difficulty from progressing the main story.""The forbidden forest is strictly off limits ... except for the dozens of poachers there roaming around like it's some family picnic sites."" But seriously though, why is there so many poachers in this game? It seems like for every 10 Hogwarts graduates, 8 of them choses poaching as their career.[b]The Combat[/b]Half the enemies have this weird coloured bubbles mechanics that requires you to pause the game mid-fight and switch between spells to break their shield before you can deal damage to them. The bubble shield mechanic looks great at first, but it quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating when the game starts throwing groups of 5~6 enemies at you at once, all with a different color of bubbles.And it's even more frustrating that half the time when you cast a spell your character will cast it to the wrong target, meaning now you're stuck running in circle for 15 seconds waiting for the spell to cooldown so that you may attempt to break their shields again.The game heavily synergize on reading enemies movement and countering their attacks using the correct spell, but it rarely becomes a reality when 6 enemies are all throwing stuffs at you simultaneously, with half of them attacking from off-screen.1v1 however is a complete joke even on the hardest difficulty.  The combat offers no challenge when you have the full attention on a single enemy. You'll have the luxury of time and correct casts to counter each and every of your enemy's action. In fact I don't recall myself losing to any of the 1v1 bosses fight.Or alternatively once you realize how powerful RB (RB is the button for throwing objects) is you can simply breaks the game by running in circles spamming RB and stones everyone to their death. Throwing object bypass most enemy mechanics, deals a great chunk of damage, while also giving you precious I-frames in battle. No need to care about your enemy's shield or what they're doing when you can just insta-kill them by pressing RB and fly some rocks into their faces. This is especially true once you learn the transformation spell and can turn smaller mobs into explosive barrels, effectively taking out 2 enemies in each fight before the combat music even starts to play.[b]The Story[/b] [i] This section contains spoilers [/i]Absolute dogshit logic everywhere. Professor Fig can Reparo a bridge but not a book with a few missing pages. [spoiler]Sebastian revealing unforgivable curses for no apparently reasons, when other spells can work just fine in his situation. [/spoiler]Poaching is bad ... unless it's you doing it, than you have the full support from Hogwarts. Doing harm against a Unicorn is a crime against humanity, but when you lock them up in a virtual world and harvest their horns every 20 minutes it is ""20 points for ravenclaws"". It baffles me a lot when professor Weasley asked me to treat Deek with respect, as she and Deek has been working together for a very long time, yet all she can spare Deek is some dirty ragcloth to wear. In fact, all house-elf working in Hogwarts still dresses like a slave with no explaination. Despite everyone is worried about the goblin invasion nobody seems to be doing anything about it. The world is seemingly dead and you're the only person alive trying to stop the goblins. There's just something special about Skyrim where there're city guards patrolling down the main roads and even setting up sentry camps on hills and chokepoints, and you can occasionally sees them slaying wolves and bandits to keep the road safe. The roads in Hogwarts however is just poachers, and goblins, and spiders. But mostly just poachers.[spoiler]The four keepers still trying to withholding information from you and put you up for their trials, even after you've told them some goblin already digged into THEIR legacy and using THEIR power to threaten the world. It makes absolutely zero senses that the keepers would throttle you by withholding information and requires you to work for it, when fundamentally speaking the entire goblin situation is their fucked up and you're just there to clean up their messes.[/spoiler]",1
"I really love this game, I have spent lots of hours playing, but suddenly I lost my all my saved files. The fix people recommends seems only one saved file will be recovered if I'm not mistaken. I want all my saved files with different characters not just one. Anyway this is ridiculous, spent money on a game i enjoy and this happens!",1

"Lets start this off by saying Hogwarts legacy is a beautiful game, its storytelling and environments are amazing.But...This game is an absolute mess.Just to begin with the fps drops and stuttering are nearly constant often causing the fights to be impossible to complete until the game fixes itself up, for however long that is. A re-occurring bug that caused the player to lock onto an enemy or object, while the camera would continue to spin the opposite direction, in turn this making the character roll in the wrong direction or just straight up shoot at nothing.I wouldn't be able to count on two hands the amount of times i was killed by a troll completely ignoring the long dash i do and just appear on top of me doing an attack (not a teleport, just straight up sliding across the floor at light speed towards the character), this wasn't exclusive to trolls just more frequent.While not as common as the other problems i found myself getting stuck inside objects frequently. In often cases walls that i should've been able to scale or climb just wouldn't work, yet i would come back 10 maybe 5 minutes later and i could climb said spot without any issues.But with all of that i still very much enjoyed the game and would've given it a positive review, until of course i load into the game and am introduced to a settings screen, the kind you get at the start of the game. All of my past files (18 hours of game play) were gone, and then magically the game crashes causing the cloud save to update. Now whether its normal for the steam cloud to delete past saves to clear up space or not i can't deal with the fact that i have to redo all of the stuff i had done before.I've requested a refund but don't honestly think ill get it.",1
"The game is poorly optimized, sluggish and suffers from constant stutters. Even with the day 1 patch, the game struggles to maintain 60 fps within the recommended developer specs.",1
"If you are on the younger side, or just really. really love Harry Potter, you will love this game.If you took the Harry Potter universe and it's nostalgic charm out of this game, you'd be left with another generic open-world puzzle game with an emphasis on collecting hidden items and completing quests where you find 50/50 of some hidden item. The story is bland and generic with no permanent effect on the wider Harry Potter world. Combat is okay, spell combos can be fun and interesting, but the novelty quickly wears off. When there are lots of enemies you spend the entire time dodge rolling over and over in a less than perfect imitiation of Darksouls combat. The best part of getting a magical letter of acceptance to Hogwarts is the new world of freedom and possibility. The exploration in this game is just so structured and regimented that you lose most of that. They try and cover up that lack of freedom and possibility by keeping you busy with endless collection quests.The game is set in a totally new time period with all new characters, and we barely get to know any of them. Only three students have any sort of in depth relationship storyline, everyone else, including important faculty are just an empty robe or obvious archetypal gimmick. Just like when that stupid acceptance letter never showed up for me in real life; it's just lost opportunity.Buy it if you can get it for basically free, or if you have small children who want to watch you play it.",1
10/10 crash simulatoranyone else getting crashes as he teleports u to the ground? i got more then enough needed system recommendations. is it a common thing happening atm or just a few?,1
I was so excited to play just for my game not to work... Like i've try and checked everything and it just runs so slow and keep crashing and restarting my pc and ugh i hate it :(,1
graphics are nice but combat is terribly clunky its a joke spell binds are just not practical on keyboard not at a fast pace at least also not really open world its more like a guided RPG i dont think anybody expected this to be a true open world game though,1
"unplayable. crashes, freezes, blackscreen etc. this release is just an insult to costumers",1
"The original hype an awe died down, the only reason to get this game is if you want to explore the school. Outside of the school seems really boring with repetitive puzzles thrown it to make it seem like there is stuff to do, and the combat is really easy.Only get this if you are a fan of the Harry Potter series and want to explore the castle.",1
"I wasn't a potter fan, but now i am. this game could be great... but WTF did they do?!this last patch is terrible and after 15 hours of loving this game. logged back in and.. IT'S ALL GONE!!!!! The amount of legwork needed to find and possibly restore lost or worse to find out there is a corrupted game file is beyond the pale for a standard user to want to endure to play a game uninterrupted. I dealt with it but its more than enough to ruin this game for so many peopleWTF?!  How is this acceptable.... a lot of people are losing everything!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY TILL THEY FIX THIS BEAUTIFUL PILE OF EXCREMENT",1
"its a nice game, but the main story is too short for the price charged. dont think its worth the price for the hours of fun",1
"bro i have 14 hours on this one save and it deleted itself twice, im so pissed right now and i dont know how to fix it. i swear on everything right now if i cant get a refund im going batsht insane.",1
"The writing in this game is amateurish. At one point a professor is asked if he thinks there could be other goblins working at the bank which can't be trusted. He responds something along the lines ""Oh no most goblins are decent folk and want nothing to do with Ramrok"" even though there is no reason someone would immediately assume that given the circumstances. Another case is when one character is recounting an event where one of your enemies cursed a child and right before he did it he says the words ""Children should be seen not heard"". It was like the writers asked themselves how can we make sure the audience really understands that this guy is evil but didn't stop to ask themselves if the line fit the context of what was happening since the child neither spoke and the curse didn't remove her ability to speak. The beginning of the game did start off pretty good but soon devolved into a nostalgia dump with zero depth. You can only speak to other characters when they are a vendor or they have a quest for you. Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are interesting at first but that's where the nostalgia dump comes in. They show you all these references of the books but pretty soon you realize all those references are on a short loop. About 4 hours in I had already seen everything of note in these locations and really wished I had gone out of my way to unlock fast travel points so I wouldn't have to run through the same uninteresting environments over and over. I would recommend this only if it had a steep discount AND you're really interested in walking around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade for an hour or two because the only thing this game does well is putting you in the world of Harry Potter it's terrible at immersing you in it.",1
"I would wait until the next patch were they fix the stuttering and frame rate drop which wasn't an issue before the patch on 2/14/23 which seems to have completely broke the game for slightly older hardware. Played for about 50 hours pre-patch on low settings and had decent graphical detail(not potato faces like now) and load times were only a brief second before entering a new area. If I had given this game a good review, it would have been only on the fact that it had quite a bit of harry potter lore. This game as a open world rpg although, meh. Any immersion feels very lacking. Just a repetitive content game without real rewards for the grind time. What point is a legendary item that gets replace with a similar level green item at the same level? What point are npcs if they don't react to anything? All characters outside of quests just follow a simple script that gets super repetitive unless you are on a quest, this goes for the scripting your character as well. I feel there is zero reason to replay this game if you can get it to play and do decide to complete 100% with how repetitively dull it becomes in the later half of the game and with only a single quest difference between the 4 houses. I also don't ever want to hear the word revelio ever again!",1
"24 hours in and after the new update my save was completely wiped. Pretty unacceptable for AAA. It looks like my autosave file are still in a save folder but the game refuses to recognize. Pretty crushed, but be wary PC users.",1
It's a prettyfun game i havent actually played an open world RPG in awhile. story's pretty good theres a lot to do it feels like i'm only around 50% done with the games story and i've sunk about 32 hours into it. there is ALOT to explore which is why i'm not finished with this game yet at time of review.,1
Game is way way to repetitive and just throws a shit tone of stuff over the map to make it feel like there is alot to do love this game but damn its so disappointing,1
"Just a few hours in so far. The world is amazing, game is super immersive outside of demographic realism from 1800s England, story seems good so far. Combat seems pretty boring so i'd mainly recommend this if you want to explore the world. Only writing this now because of a significant number of bugs. Couldn't initially play at all on Steam Deck, would crash immediately across several proton versions which luckily didn't break the completely unnecessary and anti-consumer drm limit. Also have been crashing/freezing about once or twice an hour mostly related to fast travel even on a gaming pc.If you're going to charge 60+ dollars for a game I don't think it's an acceptable release state and would avoid buying it until it can be made stable through future patches.",1
"made for console, not worth the money",1
"Game was dead on arrival for me and many other PC games. After going through many steps to have it wok with my PC I decided to return the game. I not waiting for a day one patch the game should work at launch, i'm tired off buying product that doesn't when it it is released. Brought Dead Space with my refund and I'm completely satisfied .",1
im not black :(,1
"As a person with Yennefer as my profile picture, I might honestly be done with Open-World Titles.After completing Persona 5 Royal, this game doesn't grab me in the same way at all, and to be honest, I think most of that revolves around the fact that these types of games don't have the strong, story-driven sense of direction that other linear titles such as Detroit: Become Human do.I'm not being edgy, this game just completely fails to capture my attention even in the slightest.",1
The game will barely run on the absolute bare minimum graphics. I've requested a refund even though I was really looking forward to playing this game.,1
The Witcher 3.5,1
"terrible game doesnt run well at all is super laggy and framey, would not recommend getting this game till they fix it",1
Not optimized for PC so i refunded it.,1
"Would appreciate less hand holding and exposition. Other games do a great job of telling the story while letting the player do something, something this game seems against. Limited to walking speed in most instances, and other exposition dumps are done in cutscenes that don't seem to flow naturally.",1
"The game has worked for a grand total of 33 minutes, since early release. It then crashed, and has since never made it past the loading shaders screen. Since the loading shaders screen is counted as play time, Steam will refuse a refund based on the basis of too much playtime. So, 70 dollars for 33 minutes of in game time. Seem like something you still want to play?",1
Game is broken cause it won't let me save my game's progress a week into it. I've reinstalled it multiple times as well. I paid for the deluxe edition and I expected a deluxe version but that isn't what I received. I wish I knew the game wasn't going to work at all cause I would have never spent a dime on it.,1
Love the game when I get off 11 hour shift to BSoD and freeze and crash fuck yea lets go avada kedavra my fucking ram,1
"Really want to like it.  I really do, but it's so poorly optimized it's not funny.  I can run any other game in my library on Ultra, but I have to run this on the lowest setting just to be playable.  The game still freezes and stutters when entering new areas or when enemies ""surprise"" you and the game has to render them quickly.  Just another terrible PC port.",1
It's a solid 7/8 game that is brought up if you enjoy harry potter at some point in your life. The story is pretty weak at times though and the world building outside of the school is just not there at all. Main issue I have is the pc port is absolute trash and I feel like reviews should be dunking on it more. the stutters are ridiculous even on a pretty high end 8700k 3080 pc. No settings can improve anything in certain parts of the school or hogsmeade.  Probably the worst pc port in a long while. I'd say people should definitely wait for some actual performance updates or pick it up on ps5 or series x instead.,1
i mean the games actual story quality and gameplay are top notch but the fact the textures will just lose render constantly gets old pretty quick. 2D hagrid graphics dont have the same effect in 2023,1
"Do not recommend currently, due to the below reason.Terrible performance issues on the high preset, despite my PC being more than capable of running it at Ultra at 1440p.Thought things might of got better after the patches, but it just hasn't changed anything at all.Very disappointed, and can only hope they get things sorted very quickly.---Will come back to this review if and when they fix the FPS issues.",1
game crashes before getting to the main menu,1
Elden Ring for infants and noobs,1
"Very slow pacing and the combat feels uninvolved and unrewarding. A good majority of story moments and quests felt very neglected (poor VO, animation, fetch to progress busy work, etc.)Simply not my kind of game.",1
"Downloaded this game on steam and was excited to play after waiting 4 hours to install. The game opens and crashes on the loading screen and does not work. If we're paying $90 for a game, it should at least work properly. I am so mad that purchased it. worst decision ever.",1
Runs very poorly even with great computer specs. Game runs on 60 fps then drops to 10 and so on. Even on Lowest graphics it runs like crap. Disappointing.,1
"I've ever had a game literally crash to the point of being unplayable.  I have a 3080, PC way above specs.  Every 5 minutes it crashes, taking MY ENTIRE D DRIVE with it.  Like I need to go into disk management and do a rescan to reconnect the D drive after Legacy crashes.. wtf fix your game  for PC",1
Can't kill innocent NPC's. no multiplayer. dont buy,1
"Lock, the game is good,but as steam only have yes or no, right now I dont recommend it, the game is stuttering and have FPS drop all the time, even in high end machines.I recommend wait, get a discount and a fixed game.",1
bad optimization,1
no,1
"I beat the game until the hidden ending ""lvl 34"" the start of the game is great, you can see the devs put in good effort for 3 hours of content [to get past the return period on steam], after the first few hours, the game progressively becomes more grindy by making you do pointless objectives.You have some outing quests with your companions, but their stories do not end in a satisfying way, and feel very rushed. They do not have any impact on the ending of the game. Meaning their worthless.The ending is none existent, with a trivial boss fight, and no pay off to your character or the wizarding lore. Likewise Hogwarts itself is hollow with no real secrets. Unlike even Prisoner of Askaban by EA which released more then 10 years ago- which has more secrets and hidden pathways. Classes themselves are time skips with the exception of the first 3, which the devs built. It is clear this game needed another 2-3 years to be completed, as 60-70% of the story occurs in the first 15 hours, the rest is filler and fetch quests.Likewise. the performance is questionable, i had to install two mods of nexus to fix the frame rate on this .game.  This game is a solid 5/10. It has a story- albeit bad- it has gameplay, but none of it is unique in any capacity, it has bosses [all can be one shot by a single spell], and there is no progression. Buy on a deep discount or if you have nothing else to play right now.",1
"I'm sad about this game. I am not what you'd call a massive Harry Potter fan, but I grew up with the books and the movies and it seemed like a very fun escape to that childhood memory, and if it WORKED it would be that for me and many others. But, as it is now, I literally cannot enjoy this game. It is so unbelievably, horribly optimized on PC. The game is borderline unplayable. I have a 3060 which, isn't the most powerful card on the market, but more than enough to run this game. At low settings, with DLSS on, it becomes a powerpoint presentation if you enter ANY combat, load a new area in the castle, literally CUTSCENES will stutter and lag. Until this game is updated to be playable at all, I cannot recommend it. Release your damn games functional for once.",1
"I love the game! but I can't recommend the game because I feel like the story is too short and it's heavily story driven. It felt like once you acquired all most of the spell the fun is already over.. maybe that's just me, though there are other ways to enjoy the game by either Room of requirements or exploring the rest of map and doing marlins puzzle... ""Nobody wants to do this"" maybe doing side quest but they are mostly fetching quest. If you wanna play this game and have read the books, watched movie even a fan of the Harry Potter franchise you will surely be disappointed.",1
game is good but last update performance make me can't use ultra. i have to use low to play without lag. pls fix it.,1
at some point this game will save you into a glitch where you cant move or open your menu. hour 27 for me. my only option is to restart the game because it overrides every other saved game but the last few. therefore if you load your game twice to not be stuck in a wall you will have to restart the entire game.   the game is super fun and im so very angry that my only option is to restart the entire game.   I have never felt like a video game owes me money before. 24 wasted hours with no way to not be suck in a wall is stupid.      ,1
"I feel like I got enough time in to give this a fair review and its kinda meh. I thought this would be like a Mass Effect- your choices matter- or Skyrim -open world so free you can ignore the actual storyline forever without ever getting bored or Stardew Valley idle style RPG but its not.  It feels like a whole bunch of filler and like 20 interactable NPC's. Even enemies feel sparse, not that it matters as combat doesn't give exp, which also doesn't matter because there isn't a proper talent tree but more of an unlockable perk system.Without a way to really craft and customize your character (even the creation options are presets), it doesn't feel like you are forging your own path but just plodding along the route the devs pinned you in. The most fun I had in the whole game was setting up my room of requirement and catching beasts.",1
"Game is fine, Steam is not.  Continuous updates that fail on Steam.  I've played 10 hours, but have spent nearly 30 downloading patches that don't work, at 35GB each.Downloading... 100%unpacking... 100%installing... 1%rinse and repeat.  Xbox version works fine.",1
"I am 6 hours into the game and the world and combat is where this game shines. Why I am not recommending it is because of the performance issues I have experienced. There is whole lot of stuttering, environment loading, and FPS drops. They come up when exploring, in combat, and even during cutscenes. It takes you out of the experience. I am more than willing to change this to a positive review when this game is patched but for now, the performance issues are making it unfun to play.",1
denuvo sucks ass,1
"Crashes a lot, the last boss is a bugged mess of a fight.",1
There is no costumer support for new players. I have played my self into a situation where  game is unplayable.  I will have to buy the game again from another company so I can complete the game. Steam is a waste of time.,1
"havent played much yet but im gonna give a ""careful"" warning already for those who think about buying it. cons so far:- graphics arent that great for a big game in 2023. played horizon zero dawn (game from 2017) just before this and gotta say that one had 10x the graphics of this. - that ^^ wouldnt be as bad as it is, if the performance wasnt also pretty bad. i have massive screenstutters (even in cutscenes lol) reported by others as well and my PC is savebuild with 3k investment. 3080 graphics card. 16 core prozessor, 32gb ram, best SSD etc. other games run smooth as **** with better graphics. even hyped modded skyrim or minecraft.- the narrative is for stupid people. ""oh look a door, what may be behind it, perhaps the secret this room contains"" -kinda style. you see smth, they tell you what you see as if you were to dumb to know what a door is and that there are generally things behind a door. - the players voice (at least in my female one) sounds very electronic as if an AI from other games was talking. - you cant - forfucks sake- move away more than ten meters from the quest NPC you have to follow or a super unimmersive big fat red countdown will appear warning you to stay near NPC  AND just ""kill you"" if you dont lol. it simply resets you to the latest save point. - the shaders are super bad for a new game, any other new game i played had supreme lighting / shaders. these load in late, flicker, have shadows/light where there arent supposed to be any, LODs are loaded in chunkily, etc. - the hogwarts castle looks pretty dead IMO. yes they planted lots of NPC schoolmates in there with little clichee events when you walk by, but they just do their thing and dont interact with you much besides some cringy forced dialogue from chosen NPC. many students look like the presets from the character menue, very unimmersive, most objects (like a globe you can interact with or such) are copy pasted up to 3 times in the same room, many rooms are big but besides random books and globes and same looking NPC completely empty. its like those forests where there are random generated stones and grass and trees but nothing else, ya know? empty. - cant help but think that the rocks look like b-movie props. no real corners (to many smooth edges), the colours are off, the material reflections are off, etc. - somehow the player has almost no personality so far. she acts like an NPC walking behind the narrator. ""narrator"" npc draws a wand, we draw a wand. we cant do shit on our own, seem to only say ""yes"" and repeat rethorical questions aka have no opinion. - the only combat i had so far locked my camera quite a bit in one direction because the room wasnt spacious enough, while there was no indicator to block if smth attacked you from behind. - every telescope is pointed towards a colored, milky window with NO possibility to look through at all lol. so unimmersive. - grass grows on rocks without any dirt, looks offputting weird. also clips through many objects- the 3 spells i learned so far dont do anything if you arent ""supposed"" to use them. for example: in a duel you can cast levioso to make others fly and your standard attack to damage them. if you try that anywhere lelse you cast it but noone or ""anything"" gives a fuck about it. students wont even complain they just do nothing when you fire at them. you cant lift the bookstaples or globes or plants or skeletons (deco) that you find in hogwarts, etc. its VERY unimmersive. if you kill in chicken in skyrim they massacre you. try shooting an arrow or a fus roh dah on an NPC and they wont act like you dont exist. (just to compare). - most objects arent destructible (book staples are) and spells only leave marks for 2-3 seconds before disappearing. could at least last until you reload the zone. - you cant jump or climb over reilings even if they arent high, you cant even jump from anywhere (cliffs, etc.) if you wanted to. unimmersive (also takes the need from being careful or respecting heights)- you walk into boys bathroom as a girl? no one cares. would have been a good opportunity to hide smth good in both bathrooms and make the need for you to drink some potion to go in their as someone else or come at night or whatnot. there is just so little love to detail in this game which it needed IMO. - cant even make a feather-pen(?)- sry im german- float with levioso. sad. - so far i couldnt talk with any of the countles moving pictures in hogwarts. they also dont care if you fire magic at them at all. pro so far:to be honest i think the high rating score comes from harry potter fanboys/ girls independt of the game-quality. only thing i like so far is the sound and the story is ok (even if badly narrated from NPCs that treat you like some blind bimbo). hope there will be some more as i keep playing, i might update comment.- side missions were decent so far- i like most architectural designs (ceilings, room / floor designs, etc.)- the flying pages are neat.  feels  immersive- the ""butterfly pictures"" (dont wanna spoiler) are decent. feels somewhat immersive",1
"Game doesn't work at all. I can run multiple heavy games at once and my pc is well above requirements yet it won't let me complete the tutorial with the lowest settings. Been trying for the last week now and steam doesn't even let me refund it,",1
I cant recommend this game until they fix the FPS and stuttering issues. My rig exceeds the minimum requirements by a fair margin (though not by a ton) and the game is basically unplayable even on the lowest possible settings.,1
Horrible stuttering. The real controversy should be low effort pc ports.,1
"This game would have been exceptionally great except for one fact. You are a student at Hogwarts. The fact that you are a student at Hogwarts makes 0 sense to the game. You spend most of the time not even near the castle and hardly ever interact with your fellow students. Most of the RPG systems don't really make much sense as a student. Why is my character attending class dressed in full plate armour? I thought Hogwarts was known for their nice uniforms? Uniforms in a school don't work with an RPG armour system like every other RPG known to man has. How is your ""armour"" supposed to look progressively cooler when every student is supposed to look the same?Also, why are the teachers encouraging a fifteen year old to explore the country side and burn every poacher, bandit and dark wizard alive? Avada Kedavra, quote from the wiki - ""When cast successfully on a living person or creature, the curse caused instantaneous and PAINLESS death, without causing any injury to the body, and without any trace of violence."" But no, how dare you cast such an evil spell, here, I know, burn the man alive so he can suffer before he dies, if he dies at all, lets hope he lives so he can suffer for the rest of his life!Why am I so lonely in this game all the time!? Where are all my friends and class mates? These characters are ALL boring which is okay because I can't spend any real time with them apart from a quest here and there. There is nothing special about any of them except for Sirona Ryan who's voice sounds like it was recorded from a speak and spell and is so out of place I had to download a mod to hear the ACTUAL TRANSGENDER ACTRESSES VOICE which sounds perfectly normal and lovely btw. But then if they didn't make her voice sound like a robot, nobody would have known she was transgender! Oh no! Thanks for the out of place BS. It truly did not make the game any better for me and really seemed shoehorned in.I'm on PC why am I switching to more action bars. I have at least 30 buttons on my keyboard that aren't bound to anything I could be binding them too. Combat, while still fun yet easy, would have felt a bit less clunky if they included PC only options such as that, which doesn't seem like it would take that long to implement, but what do I know, people only make these sorts of changes in mods all the time...Finally, there is a TON of misinformation about houses out there. Before I played the game I've heard ""?Gryffindor has the most side quests and Ravenclaw has the least"" and ""Every playthrough is different depending on which house you choose!"" Literally none of that is true. A single quest changes and some of the characters may or may not comment on your house... sometimes... maybe. That's it. 99% of dialogue is the same and besides that one quest, none of the game cares what house you choose. I'm gunna be honest, I didn't really need all that but if every single side quest is just an errend with no real story to it (The other children took my smelly marbles aka gobstones can you go find them for me? Yeah, that's not a story, that's busy work), maybe you could have tried a little harder here. I think I would have been fine if the house really only changed the color of your clothes IF the side quests were really meaty and had actual story repercussions but if all they are is a list of tasks to complete then where the hell is my house content?!?!?They did nail the world though, which for me rings very hallow without all of the stuff that they left luke warm. If you don't care about a games story and if you don't mind that most of the game doesn't make much sense, then this game is for you, but it seems that most people don't mind that stuff. I do.Oh yeah, and my character running around repeating Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio everywhere he went sure was immersive. Can you imagine a scene where Harry Potter is running around repeatedly casting Revelio, messing with all the random crap around Hogwarts? ""Harry, why aren't you in your bloody class?"" ""I need to find all the butterflies around Hogwarts and take them to their mirrors so I can collect their pages.""If this game didn't have Hogwarts in the title, nobody would be playing it.",1
"game in unplayable now, got into the forest and now the game freezes and runs at 10-20 fpsotherwise game has been good so far. needs fixing.",1
nah,1
"Really not worth it, I have a ton of playtime because I want my monies worth, but its a classic ubisoft kind of experience. Ridiculous and annoying amount of side quests that are not interesting and deep but shallow and meant to extend playtime, a metric ton of quest lines about collecting random things to pad out the worst and your quest log, the main story is lazy and forgettable, the best part of the game are the spells and combat but even the combat gets repetitive and difficulty is only changed by an enemies amount of health, making ""spell"" sponges on higher difficulties.",1
"do not buy this game on the computer, it is a laggy nightmare and they wont refund you it",1
shittier elden ring ??,1
only buy this if u like harry potter,1
"20hrs into the game i can no longer play without making a new save, due to clipping issues. loads then i fall through the map. no keyboard inputs will register until you fall through, even then you cant open the menu so you have to F4 out. Shame. will not start over after paying $60 what a waste unfortunately.",1
"I have played 87 hours as of writing this review. I can say categorically that there are plenty of positives to this game. Unfortunately to my taste the cons outweigh the pros in this instance...allow me to elaborate.Pros:1. A seemingly vast world to explore - When it was teased that you would be able to fly to anyplace you could see...I admit I was skeptical. However it seems my skepticism for the most part was unfounded, and delightfully so! It is true if you can see it you can fly there for the most part. Of course there are boundaries that are in place to keep players inside the rendered world. That is simply a limitation of gaming we must at present accept. 2. A fully realized and expansive Hogwarts Castle - I commend the developers, art team, and coding team for the painstaking time it must have took to create Hogwarts within the confines of today's technology! Points for all houses! The numerous little nooks and crannies of Wizarding Lore kept me busy searching for hours! Well Done!3. Meaningful choices - this becomes a touchy subject as there were times I was glad that the options seemed to favor a more cooperative approach toward others even if the choice sounded cold and apathetic. As a Ravenclaw, I felt obligated sometimes to inform some that their choices didn't take all options into account, but wanted to do so with an understanding tact. Though I must admit, were I playing a sinister Slytherin this would have infuriated me to no end. To not be allowed to be as devious and diabolical as possible; would leave me feeling that my choices truly were not my own. That instead of interacting with the world as was promised, I was yet again simply watching another Harry Potter film.4. In regards to Required space - Again I must congratulate the teams on their diligence and hard work! The Room of Requirement feels alive and acquiescent to most of my needs. Sometimes though it felt a little too acquiescent. Once one gathers the spellcrafts for the refining table, the hopping pots, and the cutting tables one begins to wonder why one would need leave the Room of Requirement. Not to mention once the Vivariums are unlocked. A meticulous and resourceful Witch or Wizard would find nearly all they need inside the Room of requirement. Save for a few ingredients, however as the Room is supposed to provide anything the student ""requires"" I must defer to J.K. Rowling and give this a Pro designation as the room does exactly as advertised! The only other thing I could nitpick the Room of Requirement for would be the lack of space to decorate, and seeing as how I wanted to spend more time in the Room I consider this to be indicative of a net positive!Cons:1. My how time flies - I was elated to see the Jack-o-lanterns floating inside the great hall! I could almost smell the pumpkin pasties and the butterbeer! I wanted so much to simply spend time sitting in the Great Hall having a good nosh and a chin wag with my fellow Ravenclaws...however there was one niggling little quest I wanted to clear out before I could feel accomplished enough to have some down time. Once finished I was returned to my room only to wake and find that snow had covered the ground and the pumpkins were gone. Replaced by garland, lights, and holly.  Overachieving sometimes does not mean overall enjoyment! I place this at the top as close as I can to the Pros as it was more my fault than anything else, though I do wish the game would have warned you that the season was about to change and hence allowed you to stay a little while longer.2. A friend in need... - Though I enjoyed the friendship quests immensely I felt left with a sense of eh at the end. I shall not spoil endings for others but suffice it to say the climax and the conclusion of most felt rushed and half baked. Points from all houses for causing me to care for someone; only to be summarily forgotten by those that called me a Friend for Life.3. Diminishing a return - Again I won't spoil an ending for anyone but suffice it to say taking the spotlight off a great achievement in gaming is a no no. To not reward the player for a hard fought win, but making them feel as though they wished they never embarked upon a journey is the antithesis of good game design. However the worst thing a designer can do would be to have other non-player characters never again mention the sacrifice or heroism of the character and only laud the obligatory NPC that followed along.4. Pockets full of potions...and other such things - Inventory management was half my game play. I was actually punished for not clearing out my inventory! I had recently learned Alohamora and was happily unlocking all things bound when I came upon a door. I unlocked it and inside was a large chest that I knew would give legendary gear. I opened it immediately knowing that whatever it was it would be a boon to help me in my coming quests...Only to be told I had no room for more gear. I quickly deleted a green hat I had been holding onto to sell once I had returned to a vendor; alas once the space was cleared the chest was already opened and did not reset as lower tier chests do. The gear that lay in wait inside had simply vanished with no option to get it back. That began my obsessive compulsive need to always open my Field Guide and delete anything of lesser or lower value. This is not how I wan't to be spending my time at Hogwarts. I'm a witch not someone's house elf taking stock of inventory!5. High flying abhorred - Flying was fun for the first 10 minutes of play. Though to feel as if you are getting anywhere at all you must either make use of flu powder or insure you upgrade your broom as quickly as possible...and don't bother using your mount. I felt as though I was trying to fly a Magic School Bus instead of a beast capable since birth of soaring through the skies. No thank you leave me my broom and Ill just take the scenic route. At least the view is nice.6. The procurement pension of a Pack-rat - I wasn't sure whether I was playing Hogwarts or Pokemon. With all the collecting in this game I feel that was the only mechanic that was completely fleshed out. Collect pages, collect spellcrafts, collect upgrades, collect ingredients, collect moonstone, collect pets, collect my sanity at the next Revelio cast it needs a break. This truly was a game only meant to give the player information about set pieces found in the world, combat and quests seemed to be an afterthought.7. You're a gambler Harry! - Because the chests give rewards based on a random loot table you may find a level three upgrade right out of the gate, or you may not find a useful upgrade until you are nearly finished with the game. This directly inhibits the players style. I found plenty of cursing upgrades but my Ravenclaw detests the Dark Arts! Not that she didn't learn the curses. Sun Tzu and all...but she would never use them! Thus these upgrades are not only worthless to my character but tempts me to change my style of play because I don't know when I will get better upgrades. If the devs simply placed appropriate gear in appropriate places or made upgrades something the player creates this would have been an easy Pro.7. A tale as old as...never mind its done move along - Again I will not spoil for others...My complaint is that with something as large as the main quests seems to want to take on; the climax and ending do not even equate to the subject matter. There is plenty of build up then in the blink of an eye it is over and dealt with. The Main story line was rushed it was hastily thrown together and the player can feel it. There is no sense of gravitas. There is no sense of impending doom, or threat around every corner. There is no more substance to them than go here and wham-o! Ok, now that that's done; back to class everyone! It was sad and completely forgettable! Were I Rowling I would disown this bit of storytelling would that someone could call it that.",1
It stutters so much for no reason even when I set it too v low settings waste of my money until they fix it.,1
Price is higher than the FPS you get.,1
"Lots of major video bugs. Will work sometimes, then all of sudden the graphics go to super low setting. The latest issues is when I log in, everything is blue with a few in-game items showing, but I cannot move.",1
"Game is unbearable on 3070 as of the moment, until they fix the stutter and lag then I will start up again. Played 3 hours and cannot return the game because I have tried every thing to fix it but this is a known issue for pc. I hope they address this.",1
"Literally unplayable! So far I've spent 4 hours across multiple attempts starting with launch and haven't even been able to get past the shaders compiling, despite having well above the minimum required specs. This has been a terrible launch and really ought to have been delayed with these kinds of issues. I know many folks are able to play so far, but a not insignificant number of people can't even play yet due to bugs and crashes. I'll likely update this when I FINALLY can play the game as I have high hopes from other reviews.",1
i'm good on another ac clone.,1
Would be an awesome game if it wasnt a lagging POS. Cannot play it with it lagging so damn bad,1
Unfortunately the game has soft locked me after 18 hours of play. Seemingly for not reason or any performance issues all of my characters files are now stuck on an infinite loading screen when trying to play. I cannot recommend as this is a game breaking issue that is seemingly happening for no reason and has also managed to corrupt all the files for this character including other separate location saved files I had made as a back up.,1
"Quest ""Take the biscuit"" is BUGGED, pls fix it asap.The locked isn't there",1
My PC is at the minimal requirements and the game still wont work with everything on low. steam wont let me refund it because i was trying to get the game to work for 3 hours and apparently i cant refund it because i played it too long. so long story short i wasted 50 pounds on a game that i cant refund and cant play.,1
needs a performance patch asap. there is some serious stuttering going on.,1
"I was enjoying the game, but after finally fixing some major performance issues with the latest patch I went to the major shop area of the game and most of my map outside of Hogwarts is missing the ground/floor. If I walk over it, I just plummet in an infinite void and no reloading or restarting fixes this. No available solution online from what I can tell other than just starting your entire game over and hoping it doesn't happen again.",1
Game seemed great for 2 hours with a few fps drops but nothing major & sure it would be patched..Patch 1 & now doesn't get above 20fps. DONT BUY THIS YET - Wait for patches & optimization because once again another AAA unplayable game. At least cyberpunk ran :8,1
fix performance,1
the game is beautiful if you just stand still but it is badly optimized for pc in its current state. best to wait a few months before buying.,1
"Will update review once PC optimization is drastically improved. Constant stuttering and virtually no GPU usage even after a recent patch. Got past the intro but once you're in Hogwarts, prepare for constant suffering",1
What the fuck is this opti ????? I have an RTX 3070 and a I7 160 go ram and the game is unplayable even in medium settings... This is a real mess better crack the game so denuno don't destroy your experience. Fuck u for the scam,1
I played for 28 hours loaded up my PC to play today and my saves where all gone. It was a great game but now that I have to start all over I am not going to play it any more crazy disappointed even though I manually  saved the game and didn't just rely on auto save.,1
"Runs terribly, unplayable for a ton of people, positive reviews are either the few who it runs well with who have good pc's with tons of ram (64) or people who are ultra forgiving and are like ""Oh hai all, games great, bit bad perf but they'll fix it, it's hawwy potta, yayyy, much recommend, bai bai"" which is so bad faith it's unbelievable.      Don't trust me tho, go look in the forums, google hogwarts bad perf, etc you'll find plenttttty.      Eitherway if they did fix the perf and made it run ok on the sys reqs they put it'd be fine.     But it's clear to anyone playing video games on pc for decades this port is terrible, it's so un optimised.",1
"ok i usually write a review after i finish a game, but i just need to get this out of the way, if you do not have an rtx 40 series don't play this game, absolutely horrendeous optimization in hogwarts, the game gripped me i was having fun, but i just cant play a game that haves 120 fps in one second and drops to 40 in the other then to 60,50,40,100. unnaceptable, do not buy this game until it is fixed",1
"the main story is pretty bad. you never get background information about the character you play, choices you make don't have an impact, so you can Avada Kedavra everyone you want, and no one bats an eye. you're also a 5th year student, doing auror work while also combing through the whole map, forbidden forest included. doesn't make much sense to me. fighting is pretty fun though.",1
pee pee poo poo cool museum,1
"I have a somewhat mixed opinion of this game. I love the environment they put a lot of detail in just the small things of the world and my favorite part is just running around and exploring. The combat is enjoyable and has a nice flow to it. These are my two favorite things about the game.The reason I can not recommend the game. Is because of the ¡°woke¡± ideology ruins the main story and characterization in the game. I could easily ignore most of it pretty easily except for the trans character. People have been excusing this as it could be possible in a magical world. But that is the very reason that is so aggravating and infuriating. You have the magic to transform yourself. This character should NOT exist in this world. If they truly wanted to be a ¡°woman¡± then they could use magic to turn into a ¡°woman¡±. But instead, we have this character who is pandered to and the whole purpose is to throw this bad line that woe is them because a goblin supported them instead of their classmates. Mind you all their customers stood up for them in the previous scene that they were in. So clearly they are accepted but they still need to say this to a child. The dev also felt to be so progressive a put a ton of female characters in the game. Which in itself I don¡¯t mind in fact there are a few good ones. But because of this, they feel like carbon copies of each other. (Mostly I am thinking of the professors here.) Also the second hand evil character here is a blundering top hat mustached villain, laughably clich?. (Which he has yet to do anything actually evil.. At least with Voldemort you knew that he would happily kill babies.)So instead of making a fun story, the devs attempt to appease a group that not only attempted to boycott the game but continues to insult the devs. Purely because they made this game based off of J K Rowling's world. This ¡°wokeness¡± is the very reason the movie entertainment is going down the drain. I would hate to see all triple-A games follow in its wake.",1
Two times now this game has deleted my save.,1
"Well, what can i say? I loved it till i got a bug that permanently dissabled my floo flames. So now im fk'd. What an enormous bummer.....",1
"Currently, this game has many graphical issues. The water textures are glitching all over the place and now a new glitch appeared where I fall under the map and I can't do anything. I can move and do Revelio but I can't use the map and handbook because it doesn't react. Now I'm stuck there and can't leave. All in all, this game is very good, big for exploration, nice combat system and a really cool story but at this state, it is unplayable.",1
"Give me back my money. I paid for the game and I can't play it on my RTX 3060. It crashed on shaders loading, but I fixed it with some random solution from youtube but it still crashes at other place. Are you freaking serious? This is AAA game I paid for?",1
"Stanley Stammer and the Frame Rate Prisoner Is this a good game ? Yes.. for the most part it is.However, the post launch patch has rendered the game an unplayable stuttering mess for many players. Pre-patch I had good performance, solid FPS and no stuttering (running on an older 6 core i7 with GTX1070). New patch lands and boom this thing stutters worse than Max Headroom on a bad day.Cast a spell? half a second freeze and then a stutter. Turn around? Yep, that's going to cost you 90% of your FPS and a few more st st st stutters.Sort it out Devs..",1
so glitchy its a joke even exiting the game takes forever remins me of cyberpunk the mod community will fix it thankgod ,1
The frame rate is soooo bad in this game it makes it unplayable,1
Idk what it is but this game isnt it for me. This is my second triple AAA game that I bought with elden ring being my first. I didnt find the story intriguing and interesting and the gameplay just feels dead. The NPCs make the same moves and the enemy battles are boring. I will try to finish the game and maybe im going to change my opinion but as of right now i wouldnt recommend it.,1
no lag but the screen is always spiking,1
"This game will not run no matter what. As soon as it begins to load gameplay it immediately crashes. It plays smooth on the Steam Deck which is where all my play time has came from since my moderate computer (R7  & 2070S) cant load even on low settings 30fps. I have updated drivers , re-installed, still crashes.",1
Stuttering and bad performance make it unplayable for me right now (RTX 2080s),1
the game is really glitchy,1
Feb 14 patch broke the game for me. It used to run but now it just crashes after the seizure warning. Just posting this review while I'm waiting for my refund.,1
"You cant do anything to your classmates (or anyone other than poachers), you cant play quiditch, and you cant poach animals.",1
"Good graphics and immersive world.  The pace is very, very slow.  Very.",1
"Cyberpunk day 1 ran better than this... also please fix the cloth physics, the robe keeps going inside the player or bugs out and parts of it inverts it self Postal III had better coat physics than it. besides the fact that my RTX 2070 super is getting a beat down from this, the game was fun till i reached the school and the farther i progressed the more laggy it became",1
stuttering issues make the game unplayable. gonna update this review once that fixed,1
"[h1]Rating: 4/10[/h1]This game is full of wasted opportunities which would otherwise have made a great game. The developers are relying too much on fillers, like finding over one thousand collectibles or repetitive puzzles and side quests.Loot and items are pretty much pointless. Things like brooms and wands do not make any difference. Got a legendary clothing piece? It will be replaced in a minute by a green level item and inventory management becomes tedious.After a while the game just felt like a chore.Don't be fooled by the amount of hours Steam displays. Getting 100% in-game and 42/45 achievements took about 67 hours, but it was not fun.Now I will have to force myself through it and replay part of the game three more times to get the last achievements.[b][u]Positives:[/u][/b][list][*]Graphics[*]Environment is beautiful[*]Atmosphere[*]Concept[*]Visual clothing options[/list][b][u]Negatives:[/u][/b][list][*]Story is short and forgettable[*]Does not feel like a RPG game at all[*]Lots of bugs, some are progress halting and requiring loading earlier save[*]Stuttery[*]Can't unlock all talents and no re-spec[*]Some achievements require replaying part of the game 3 more times[*]Too much woke and agenda pushing for my taste[*]Crashing and memory leaks[*]Music[*]Denuvo[*]Dialogue choices does not matter[*]Dialogue is cringy[/list][b]Performance:[/b]The performance in general was barely acceptable. Average fps was about 90 to 70-ish but would often drop into the 30's, even with DLSS (which games should not rely on to make up for lack of optimization).Walking around, especially in Hogwarts would stutter a lot.My computer is far above the recommended specs: CPU: Intel i9-9900K 5,2 GHz sustained on all cores -HTGPU: Evga RTX 3080 ti FTW3 Ultra 12GBRAM: Corsair Dominator 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 16/18/18/36 3200 MHzSSD: Samsung 970 EVO Plus M.2 500GBMonitor: Lenovo Legion Y27gq-20 1440p 165HzIn the end I would just say it is sadly a wasted potential and absolutely not worth full price.",1
"Laggy and unplayable with i7, 3080 and 32gb ram",1
i loved it i played for 20 hours before i opened it to find all my characters gone if they tested their game and did their job this would've been fixed,1
"[b]SHORT[/b]I guess what i don't like the most is that i cant live up my DARK BROODY MYSTERIOUS DARK WIZARD arcand game is too bright[b]LONG[/b]I've been HP fan since I was 6, basically grew on these movies and still rewatch them quite often. I'm 23 now. And of course I really wanted to play this game, since there never was any game at this quality level in the HP universe. However, with my absolute open mind towards this experience, it left me with mixed feelings. [b] ATMOSPHERE [/b]The dev team did a great amount of work rebuilding and redesigning the Hogwarts so it will be interesting to explore and player won't get tired of the same brick n stones - I get that, however throughout my journey I couldn't help but feel that overall this doesn't feel like Hogwarts. The music, some parts of Hogwarts, overall vibe, the whole ancient magic arc and new architecture just seem alien to me. [b] GAMEPLAY [/b]Looting system is annoying, nothing feels achieved. I skip the chests sometimes because I just don't feel the motivation to open them - most of the gear looks boringly designed and I know i will have to clear up the space for it anyway. There's very little you can interact with in the game. There's repetitive puzzles here n there, another cute looking hidden room, but at the end of it just a box with another pair of gloves or glasses. Everything feels repetitive and loses it's charm after 10 hours of the game. [b] CONSEQUENCES [/b]In Hogwarts Legacy it doesn't matter if you are killing with Avada or torturing with Crucio. All your choices have no consequences in the game - no matter which house you gonna choose, or what you gonna say, or if you gonna kill. I guess it's OK for some people who haven't been playing in games where it matters, but idk, I feel like once you've tried it it's really hard to come back. Maybe I made a mistake playing Red Dead Redemption prior New Year - if we talk about best open world game I just come back to this one. Even tho it was not RPG. Or at least Witcher, to that matter - same genre but what it has that Hogwarts legacy doesn't is an insane story and impressive characters, much deeper gameplay and overall bigger amount of details. [b] CONCLUSION [/b]This Hogwarts doesn't feel like Hogwarts to me. During my first two hours of the game I realised that best to see it as alternative Wizarding World. It's engineered to be too cute and simple just to be interesting to the most casual players. But it's impossible to please everyone. I will just keep to the movies.",1
BORING ASS GAME FOR SOYBOY NERDS,1
"HOGWARTS STUTTERY Once again a terrible PC launch. The game play itself seems decent, problem is it runs like absolute shite. 3080ti-3900x can't even run the game in 1440p without constant stutters. It's another release broken fix it later kinda deal. Too think it runs and looks better on a ?500 console. Why did I pay ?1000 for a graphic card that advertised ray tracing when I can't even run ray tracing. Can't believe yucky consoles get better treatment than PC players.",1
"Beautifully crafted world with attention to detail, the art direction is spot on, and I especially like the soundtrack. However, I can't recommend the game due to the poor optimization and stutters. It's frustrating to buy new hardware to play games like this while developers release these games in such unoptimized state. When the optimization improves, I will change the rating to positive.",1
"RTX 2070 Super hereVery bad performance not even at bare minimum acceptable level. Did every ""guide"" out there on YT and Reddit, nothing working. We don't have to go through all of that in the first place. No updates from devs nor any communication regarding these issues. Literally unplayable.",1
"Shockingly bad performance, don't buy until they actually optimise it for PC",1
"apparently, a Muggle high-end PC isn't enough to run this game. Love the game in terms of story, exploration, and magic but I cannot recommend because it is extremely unstable.. consistent frame drop issue takes away all the fun. I hope the wizards and witches at Avalanche fix this damn thing!",1
fun until you realize you cant actually be evil until late game,1
"I did enjoy the game when it didn't crash, but it does crash quite a lot and I have tried various 'fixes' to no avail.Edit: Game runs excellent until it doesn't.",1
Was fun being a wizard and stuff. The games main story being done in 3 hours is not fun. Other than that I padi 70$ for an achievement hunting game cause thats the only end game. even the O.W.L.S werent the end game. Either wait for dlc and price drop or wait for the modding community to make this THEIR game.,1
The game constantly shuts down on its own. I have to restart the computer every time that it happens just to get the game to start up again. Really annoying.,1
"Alright, SO FAR (because I don't want to forget anything as I continue playing) the characters voice sounds like she's talking through a tin can. It sounds all weird and modulated, like the developer didn't take any time to even try to make it sound like... well, a person. Which is especially annoying, because every interaction you have for a quest has character dialogue. Next, what is up with the sleeping on the ground to wait animation? Seriously, you went through the whole process to create the house dorms for all four houses and I cant even sleep in my own bed? Absurd. I'm separating this one into its own paragraph, because it needs to stand out. Why are the cosmetic options tied to specific items? They should be tied to the item slot, not a specific item to overwrite. Upgrading gear is a tedious burden because each time I have to go into the items and overwrite them to have my character continue to look the way I have them dressed.Finally, the controls for the broomsticks suck. rather than putting all of the movement on the left stick and looking with the right stick, they split movement between the two and only allow looking left and right... with the right stick. So one stick controls both vertical movement and looking left and right. Tell me you've never developed a video game, without TELLING me you've never developed a video game. Smooth brain mechanics.",1
"12600K 4070tiUnplayable.The introduction runs perfectly fine, but once in Hogwarts, it is constantly stuttering and freezing.It looks to be an awesome and beautiful game though, so I hope they'll fix it soon enough.",1
"geniunly runs like shit, fast travel takes like 5 minutes and alot of dialouge gets skipped, it freezes quite alot and its just genuinely unplayable.",1
"Game is BROKEN Don't buy until they fix it. Works fine till you get like 12 hours in or at Hogwarts then we take a trip back to PlayStation 1 land! Where characters look all blocky and the textures pop in and out, MOSTLY out. FIX IT or give me my money back and I'll change my review.Enjoy my $110 WB Games!!!!",1
Cyberpunk on PS1 runs better than this.,1
tbh kinda mid game. 6/10edit: with the 14th of feb performance patch its gone from mid to actually unplayable across all settings (it usually ran on high to high-medium). unacceptable. i hope steam issues a late refund,1
"Seems like a fun game if it was playable, freezes constantly on my 3070. I'd personally hold off purchasing until they fix it. Seems like a poor console port for PC",1
"Super low fps, didn't like fighting mechanics",1
"The game is great, but I would wait for some serious updates before buying it.Firstly, if you need help finding the place to buy combat seeds, it's north of Hogsmeade. The marker for the shop is conveniently blocked when you open the map. Scroll up a bit and you should find it. I had to look this up because shops don't appear until you zoom in on a town, and the default zoom has the marker blocked by the ""world map"" and ""Hogwarts map"" tabs at the top of the screen. Also, if you can't find the room of requirement on the hogwarts map, select the ""Secret rooms"" tab and it will show up. Not sure why it doesn't just show the floo. My second issue is it does a terrible job of explaining things. The best example of this is the lock picking mini-game that should never have existed, and I wish you could turn off. You spin the wheels until the green and orange cogs start turning, then hold the position until the lock opens. Nowhere is this explained. It gives you the spell, throws you in the mini-game, then says ""spin the wheels to open the lock"" and that's it. I had to look it up since you can't exit the mini-game and there are no other indicators of what to do.Last but not least, the combat feels bad. It's not so bad when you have three of four enemies, but any more than that and you'll be spending more time dodging then casting. Not parrying by the way. The number of times a prompt hasn't shown and I lost half my health is absurd. It also wouldn't be so bad if spell switching wasn't so annoying. I'm playing on controller, so I have to hold RT and push a direction on the D-pad to change spells. Each direction has four spells slotted, and you swap between them. The problem is, RT is also basic cast AND held to spell cast. There have been COUNTLESS times when I'm try to change spells and accidentally cast something or vice versa. Then your stuck standing there staring at an enemy with a colored shield, who can't take damage until hit with a specific spell, while his friend comes in from off screen to chunk you for half your health bar. Because you know... missing prompts. Again, overall the game is fun, but I can't really recommend it since I've had situations where I've just had to put the game down in frustration and walk away due to stupid nonsense.",1
"A mid tier game that is over-hyped because its related to Harry Potter, boring plot that goes nowhere.Yo can't even interact with NPCs.",1
"The game is cool for the first 5 hours but quickly becomes a repetitive mess. A lot of the characters look and talk the same way and outside of Hogwarts, the game doesn't have much to offer. There isn't enough diversity in the characters, combat, quests, or open world for me to continue to play this without it feeling like a chore.",1
"I have to say, I'm really disappointed with the optimization of this game. I'm playing it on my RTX3070 laptop with 16GB RAM and even though I'm only running it on 2k medium graphics without ray tracing, the game frequently experiences sudden drops in frame rate, especially during cut scenes or conversations. No matter what settings I adjust, the frame rate just doesn't improve, and I often have to restart the game to make it playable again. It's frustrating because I know the game has so much potential to be immersive, but these optimization issues just keep dragging me out of the experience. It's not just me either; I've seen a lot of criticism about this problem online. At this point, I can't even focus on playing. I really hope the devs can address this soon with a patch or update. If they do, I'll happily change my comment to reflect the improvements.",1
"Terrible performances on a setup well above the recommended. Tried every ""fixes"" available online. First it was heavy stutter and frame drops but after 25 hours the game started crashing every 30 minutes.",1
"The latest update has destroyed the game for me. I can't run it more than 30 secs without a crash. It was fine, if a bit stuttering, before. Now the game is literally unplayable. For reference, I have 12900k + 3080",1
"Multiple performance issues, buggy game features.",1
"Do not buy this game if you care about graphics, runs poorly with a 4090 and a 13900k at 4k and doesnt even look that great",1
"I knew my PC specs are on the lower end and wanted to test the game for myself. Unfortunately in the first 70 minutes of gameplay I felt like there was about 50 minutes of cutscenes (not actually playable content.) And at the start of those cutscenes the fps drop was significant.I returned the game in the 2 hour play period on steam, because it didnt really felt I played those 2 hour, but was just watching not very interesting movie about unknown wizard.",1
"Runs like cr@p, my PC is well above recommended system requirements, running settings lower than the games benchmark recommends doesn't fix it. Unfortunately the patch released hasn't helped at all. I was so excited for this game but I couldn't possibly review it's content as it's been unplayable for me. The only thing I can say is the character creation was desperately lacking. Purchase at your own risk.",1
my save file after playing for 30hours is gone. i need to start from 0,1
makes you restart the game after getting so far even if you sAVE UP TO DATE,1
Stuttering all over the place,1
"Game is good, but until the performance issues are fixed, I can't recommend it.",1
Repetitive and your choices make no difference to the outcome of anything. It doesn't feel like an open world RPG at all.,1
"I've found the game very clunky, things like being forced to walk next to NPC at snail speed for instance is not entertaining.  The menu and general UI is terrible, feels like an after thought.Twice I had to load old saves as I randomly got stuck in objects.I didn't really find the game fun, but once you pay for it, you continue in the hope that it improves, it doesn't.",1
Not worth the time invested. Very repetitive missions and puzzles. Decisions make no difference what so ever.Only like 5 different enemy types. Main story missions bland and too short for a AAA title. Only buy if you are a massive HP fan.,1
"what da hell is going on with performance? it goes worse and worse! where and when did you loose DLSS? it's just not anymore an option suddenly! today i simply can't play because of performance and crashes on boot.you loose it, seriously. the game is interesting (even though a lot of narrative choices look weirdly placed while trying to balance between own story and Potter's books), a lot of activities, beautiful world. But then UI could be much better (especially the map UX).Still performance is a killer of this game for sure.",1
"14 feb 2023 patch broke the game, wont load...dont buy it until sure they fixed it",1
Huge performance issues. Framedrops and freezing,1
"Stop the pc nonsense!Why the heck does a kind female looking bartender speak like a stupidass trans motherf**ker?Shouldn't I have the freedom to choose whether being imposed with those minority stuff?Centuries ago trans already in England!? That's so very modern.There are always better ways to do such thing, but you chose the most disappointing and offending way, since the majority preferences are not considered, as there's no choices for us players but to take it. (And the skipping is different at that part, think someone else noticed that as well.)Minority is minority for a reason, it's not mainstream! People all have their freedom, but why not the minor stay accordingly like their portion in society? why do I need to see them everywhere?Tired.thumbs down, as a tainted painting it is.",1
"Its nice, but there is so much tiny mistakes or tiny things that can be done better. The ambientation and music are great, but you cannot talk with anyone, only with people pertinent to the quest, the secrets are easy and you have one spell to find them, so when you enter a room you throw revelio and there is that.Performance : 0",1
"Lacks quality of life features.Lacks immersion - you can't sit, can't sleep, can't join the main hall dining table, don't have a schedule to keep up with.Puzzles are basically 'cast left-click three times'.Forces you to fulfill side quests and interact with characters you don't want to.Hogwarts itself is tiny.You can't have meaningful conversations with npcs.You can't have friends and spend time with them.You can't pet owls you encounter.You can kill. Nobody ever mentions this. As if it is normal for a 15-16 year old to routinely go hunt dark wizards.There are no house points on display, even if a professor says 'points to house', nothing changes.And last but not least - why does every professor treat the protagonist as a second coming of Merlin himself? They are almost licking the protag's boots.",1
Game crashes if try to use the floo flames to travel after like 10 minutes of playing.,1
"I'm trying to enjoy this game, but it's very difficult due to performance issues.I can run almost all game on high or ultra settings, so I believe my hardware is not the problem.I'll change this review as soon as it is fixed.Thank you.",1
"The game looks great, I cant wait to play it.. The game recommends I play on medium settings. Even with everything turned to the lowest settings, there is so much stuttering and lag its unplayable. Until the devs fix this issue for myself and many others, I cannot recommend.",1
"The game has strong start, the castle itself is gorgeous, combat is okay. And that is all for the positives. It gets progressively worse as you play, after 20 hours it's unbearable chore. Very repetitive and every game design decision is totally uninspired (even worse then the terrible Ubisoft open world games), the story itself lacks drama and emotional moments. Only recommended to Harry Potter fans who have no experience in gaming and modern OCD players who want dopamine hits from collecting every fart and achievement.",1
cant buy a broom kinda sad ,1
Slideshow on 3090 ti. Poorly optimized,1
"It looks pretty and awed me at first, but this gameloop is insanely basic and feels like any ubisoft game with a harry potter skin on it, puzzles are way too easy and they just dump trash loot all over you. Feels pretty soulless.",1
"From a huge harry potter fan: this game is a high production mess of endless grind with none of the character soul nor relevant moral choice to turn the main character into something interesting.Magic is and always was a backdrop to asking you who you are- Brave Neville, clever Hermione, strategic Ron, and what would you do under pressure?I, like Severus Snape would have said 'always'.Not this time. I was so excited. I'm so bored.And our first potential friendship moment happens in the library with sebastian and we just...... get no choice and a shitty cutscene?ALSO HOW DOES TIME WORK? THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONG GONE after fighting through like 20 guards.AND THERES NO TIME TURNER.This is Harry Potter for chat GPT brought to you by Brawndo. Its what plants crave.Not me though I'm out.",1
No. ( Proper review to be added. ),1
"It's been a fairly miserable experience so far. Characters are overly kind, could seriously not care less about the villain or even care to remember their name, next to no roleplaying in terms of gameplay or player expression. This was shat out in the Unreal 4 application.",1
saved characters were all magically deleted .. good thing i wasted 60$ on this,1
"You can't say i didn't give it a fair chance.. At the beginning I really enjoyed the game, but it turned into a repetitive, boring grind very fast. The story is poorly written full of plotholes, nothing you do matters. I choose the ""bad"" ending but was still praised as a hero of the school, excuse me? I never felt like I was part of the world in any means, whatever I did had no impact. Using forbidden spells in front of anyone? No consequence, it's not even acknowledged. Randomly shooting people with anything? Same thing.Performance is bad, graphics are questionable, RTX settings are just for decoration. It's a real shame, there was way more potential in this than what it turned out to be.",1
6/10 || 7/10 If Harry Potter fanVery average game.Pros1. Amazing visuals and world building/exploration2. Combat is simple but feels flashy and nice. Spells are fun.3. Dialogue is okay. Some side quests are interestingCons1. Really generic protagonist2. Cliched main story3. Choices don't really matter much and puzzles are subpar4. Inventory and gear system is all over the place and there is no build variety5. Combat never really gets difficult and you can spam spell for the win,1
After playing the game for 50+ hours without any problems the most recent patch destroyed everything for me.I bought the Deluxe Edition and RTX 4070 Ti specifically to be able to play this game but the stuttering makes the game a veritable slideshow. I have even tried to restore the game files to the previous version - didn't help.Feeling scammed right now as I am unable to play the game.,1
"I game based in 1800's Inner American City place called Hogwarts, its really immersion breaking.",1
"Nice fan service, the rest of the game sucks",1
game wont open since the recent patch,1
"The game seems pretty fun but it is so poorly optimised, I have a 3700x, 3070, 16GB RAM, and run on an empty ssd. Even on the lowest graphic settings without ray tracing the game still stutters and struggles to close down.",1
Runs like shit on a 3070 ti so refunded,1
STUTTERING,1
"What an amazing game, sadly the greatness is held back by that p!ss poor performance.",1
Filled out with copy past challenges and forced 100% everything for max level. forced constant hid and seek not a puzzle just no fun,1
The game is still riddled with stutters and fps drops at random points.I love HP and would buy this again in the future once they iron out these things.,1
Refund speed run,1
not really honestly. harry potter has always been a series i kinda liked. and i was hoping to be immersed into the world with this game. it honestly was fun for a bit. but it grew stale overtime. its probably just me and my odd taste though.combats flunky. and i ended up finding it far too easy even on the hardest difficulty. and i really hated the bullet sponge enemies who like lunge at you from across the battlethe games buggy. and runs like shit as well. it appears the devs really didnt know. or bother to optimize it that well. the game isnt THAT good looking to chug like it does. this is most obvious in cut scenes. for some reason(probably not pre-rendered?) either way. i am not crying over it. i got it for free anyway. but. its honestly. kinda mid. and the whole controversy and community isnt really..the best to put it lightly. i feel the devs really want to seperate themselfs from the whole controversy and be for everyone. they even have a trans character in the game. all in all. its a mid game honestly. but it might just be what is a harrypotter fans wetdreams. i dunno if its alright to buy. considering JK's stances on some human rights issues. but its not gonna harm her pocket if you dont buy it anywayoverall. i dont reccomend it. personally at least. for it being mid. and ethical concerns,1
"PC performance issues are shocking, games been out for a week and still no fixWait till the devs actually care enough about their audience to patch the game",1
"Honestly it feels like an interactive movie aimed at consoles and not PC's. The game requires you to press a different button for various actions. It's pretty anti-immersive. The way the cutscenes are also done is more like a movie, unlike how Half-Life tackles such things.If you fixed up the controls, there may be something special.",1
"Until the performance issues are addressed and fixed, I won't be recommending Hogwart's Legacy.",1
no Ukrainian interface language,1
Game keeps crashing,1
"If you're into the potter universe, you should buy this game, but not yet. Hold off until the performance issues are fixed, as currently, even after the recent 300 mb update, the game still drops to 5 fps relatively often whenever loading in new areas or in combat, which just takes away from the experience. That being said, the game is great. Not as long as reported, the devs claimed there was 30+ hours of main storyline quests, whereas I only had 20 hours worth including a bunch of exploration, side quests etc. Bottomline I rate the game:World 10/10Combat 8/10Customization 9/10Exploration 9/10Story 7/10Performance 3/10Save the experience for when the game is optimized. ",1
too much talking not enough action. im sure the game is amazing but i cant walk for 2 minutes without talking or cut scenes!! it's annoying as hell for players that want more fighting and a lot of FPS drops,1
"Side Quest walls make this game extremely boring, endless grind simulator with weak mechanics. Better have few solid one.",1
"It's very hollow. The majority of the characters are empty and bland, leaving them to feel designless, like they're just some random background NPC in both appearance and personality. It feels like everything is hiding, nothing sticks out besides some of the visuals and architecture of the world, everything has a very witchy cosy vibe and it's quite nice, but in this cosy world it's full of waste, endless trash loot and boring collectables, so so many boring collectables. leave me alone Merlin I don't want to see your cutscene for the 100th time just to increase my inventory by 10 slots. At least the clothes are cute and the transmog system is REALLY good and easy to use.Your character is perfect at everything (Besides moving, you float around and control really badly), you're a dandy do-gooder and ALSO a chosen one of sorts. You make your character but it's not really yours, you have no flaws or downsides to your character, your dialogue choices are empty and without consequence. Speaking of character, the character creation is very mediocre (you can't change gender, skin or face type later on which sucks), just an okay amount of presets, no sliders. It's a boneless game, very soft, no edges. Also, it's very strange to see how horrible people are being, especially more left leaning people as you'd think they might be a bit more sympathetic towards things. Seems like people are making themselves ""The good guys"" by hating this game for ideological reasons and that gives them an excuse to be a horrible toxic person. Regardless of what you think is morally good or bad you are still a horrible vitriolic person and it's pretty sad. Not very wholesome cosy core witch at all.",1
i don't get it,1
half baked game - put it back in the oven.every 5 mins of playing this game the pc starts to sound like a lawn mower.,1
fun until you realise how fucking shittly this thing is optomised cars 3 ran better than this shit on my old ps4,1
Cannot even start the game,1
"If you like Harry Potter, I recommend the game. Beautifully crafted environments, lot's of lore tibids and side quests that enhance the world.Otherwise, it's a fairly mediocre open world game. The main story is average, there is some crafting and collecting if you're into that. Combat is okay, enemies are little too spongy, and it's mostly just about rotating dodge, parry, spellcast and basic attack. I didn't particularly like dungeon exploration and puzzles. Overall, it feels similar to an open world Assassin's Creed game.Considering you're not a Harry Potter fan, I wouldn't pay more than $30 for it (hence the negative review).",1
"This game is ruining mine and my boyfriends relationship, I am holding his computer hostage until I have completed this game because I refused to upgrade my PC....",1
"HP is one of my dearest memory of childhood. I had high expectation of this game. However, the dev have yet to fix this shuttering issue. This issue have been going on since early access and the recent ""performance patch"" on 14 Feb did not fix this issue. I know I should be patient but we as a consumer should have the right to play an ""OPTIMIZED"" release game.I lost all magical feeling for this game.The dev should had address this issue on their social media to restore players confidence instead of keeping us in the dark.As such, I don't recommend this game to anyone who is a potterhead. Unless you want to get your childhood destroy in this incomplete game.This review will still be negative if the shuttering issue is fix down the road to remind myself that game dev nowadays love to release ""UNOPTIMIZED GAME"" and doesn't care for the players.",1
cant attack students,1
"This game looks nice. That's the only good thing I can say about it. Everything about the game play is awful. It's so bad that it's hard to pick where to start. The core experience is a never ending scavenger hunt. There are hundreds if not over a thousand random useless things hidden all over the world for you to find. That's wildly annoying on its own, but it is made worse by many of these items being locked behind shallow puzzles that exist to waste your time, if not locked behind spell specific locks to force you to retread the same areas multiple times as you unlock those spells. Some puzzles and locks require you to complete a puzzle lock to access them, and because that's not enough excess, you have to spend the entire game spamming your magical sonar to reveal the vast majority of collectibles. The sonar sees through floors and walls so you can't even access many of these items while others are barely revealed for less than a second before vanishing so you have to keep spamming the sonar and hunting the ping to find them. By the 4th hour I was ready to abandon this pointless waste of time, but collecting crap is required to level up, so you can't even opt out of it.The game loves to waste your time. The castle is a maze and the wider world is a vast expanse of beautiful nothing. It's a slog to retread. The devs obviously thought so too, so they put fast travel points every few feet. You must find them by almost touching them first and then you can travel to them, but the map is locations within locations within locations and no details, so you seldom know where you need to go, so you end up walking there anyways. On the subject of wasted time, entering your map or menu screen has a several second delay. Then there are about 9 or 10 tabs in the menu and there is a delay between each. You will constantly be using these so expect to lose several minutes every play session waiting on menu screens to load. This game is a big budget triple-A game in all the worst ways. So you better believe the bloat and excess and waste of time continues into your clothing. Each piece of clothing has stats and slots. You are inundated in new clothing. So you are constantly entering the menu, tabbing over to gear, entering each piece and swapping to your +1 better gear. But then you look like a freak with all this wacky gear so the devs give you the ability to use the cosmetics of any piece of gear you have owned on any piece of gear, so if you like not being a mismatched multicolor nightmare now you must back out of your newly equipped piece of gear and re-enter using a different button to reset the visuals of the gear. Why was clothing not 100% cosmetic? Why couldn't stat increases have been tied to your character rather than gear since any piece of gear can look like any other piece of same type of gear? It's multiple pointless systems and steps just to bloat the experience.As bad as everything is, somehow combat is worse than all of the rest combined. It is a cumbersome unintuitive disaster. 12 buttons, 2 sticks, and a D-pad. Every other game has figured out how to put an entire game worth of controls into these. This game couldn't figure it out. You have an attack button if you tap it, but to cast spells you must hold it and use a face button, but there are dozens of spells and only 4 spaces so you must equip and unequip them in a separate menu. You better believe that menu is also stupidly designed. Expect to be constantly swapping spells. You also have spells you can't remap on the D-pad, including magical sonar. There is a lock-on that struggles against multiple enemies which is every battle and a free aim that you will seldom use and can't use with some magic. It's weird and hard to explain how bad it is. Actual combat usually throws multiple enemies at you. Each waits a second or two, then does a 1 second telegraph before instant teleport attacking you or range attacking you. You have a dodge and shield that functionally do the same job, but these are face buttons so you can't be in the process of doing other magic when it is time for your quick time event dodge. You are constantly swapping between dodging, blocking, and trying to spam some damage on damage sponge enemies. By the time you are able to enter the wider world enemies all come with different colored shields that can only be temporarily broken with specific magic, so you need a range of specific magic equipped, and then you must fight targeting to select the right enemy, hold attack and choose the correct face button to break that shield, then spam your attack or use one of your other face spells to attack, and at any time multiple enemies can be instant killing you from the other side of the room. Enemies are all tanks. You die in 2-3 hits on hard, about 4-5 on normal, and that's while you are overleveled and in the best gear. Everything about combat feels awful.Everything about the gameplay sucks, but somehow everything outside of the gameplay sucks too. You would expect that as a student in a magic school you would attend classes and in your free time do other stuff. You will spend days and nights wandering the vast countryside and committing murder against murderers, and when you feel like it you can occasionally do a class mission as a tutorial. Did I mention yet that the entire game is nothing but tutorials. Don't expect to learn anything because while the tutorials tell you what they want you to do, they refuse to explain HOW to do them. You will have to learn to play on your own time while being murdered in the field or while hunting for the 54th hidden book page in the 27th location. Each location has its own collectathon goals. Nothing you do makes it feel like you are a student. The game should have just had you be an adult wizard fighting dark wizards. The school exists as just a maze full of things to collect. You are forced to engage with npcs that are mostly miserable and shallow. I ran into a lady who had dedicated her life to unlocking a mystery no wizard has ever solved. I then solve it in a second and she abandons her life's work because she was just a tutorial 10 hours into my play time. Students are universally annoying and give you fetch quests or just want to waste your time. It would be fine if any of them were likable, but they aren't. The teachers are all fine but you barely interact with them outside of their missions/tutorials, which often involved doing other missions/tutorials to fulfill theirs. The game just goes on and on with its excess, bloat, frustrations, and time wasting. I didn't mention learning spells. It's an mini-game of pointing down a path and occasionally tapping a button. I never failed, but I imagine if you do you just redo it because you MUST have these spells to progress the game. So why have these in the game at all? They accomplish nothing and have no stakes. I also didn't mention the stuttering or characters with faces that don't load or animate while they are talking. Honestly, glitches, bugs, and poor performance are the least of the game's issues. I wanted this game to be good. I liked the books. But it dropped the ball in every conceivable way, except for looking nice. I will take a good game that looks like crap any day over a bad game that looks nice.",1
This game has lots of potential.,1
Fucking just played almost 60 hours on this game and for it to crash my computer deleting my whole save .. was about 65 % of the way in with all the quests and everything.. AAA+ games have gone to major hell.. and now its discerning playing this losing a whole save .,1

"I'd rate this neutral if I could, but having to pick between good and bad I gotta pick the latter I'm afraid:Pro:- the World: Hogwarts is awesome, Hogsmeade is nice. The rest is... serviceable- combat is better than expected- music- visuals- voiceacting- atmosphere (in Hogsmeade/Hogwarts anyway)Cons:- all the copy pasted open world garbage: It's all so basic and identical that I don't think you could even simplify it further. 'Cairn dungeons' is the phrase they use to describe a tunnel of 200m length with a chest at the end. They copy pasted the very same cairn 'dungeon' about 150 times. Spoiler: The tunnel has right, left turn. Don't get lost.- combat falls entirely flat towards the 2nd half. Same enemies, no customization and the stat system shows it's flaws: troll 3 levels above you will 1-2 shot you which is fine, but a troll 5 levels below you can't even touch you.- there's about 10 enemies in this game total. And that's being generous. Goblins/Dark Mages/Trolls/Spiders. These 4 cover 99% of enemies you'll fight.- performance is still fairly poor. It runs okay'ish on higher end hardware but nothing more. And on this point: The promised 'Day 1' patch came 1 week after pre-launch and did little to nothing.- Difficulty: I played on hard and was a breeze. I understand this isn't a Souls game. But there's difficulties for the casuals, where is the difficulty for people who like a challenge?- Controls are kinda clunky, both on controller AND M/KB. Consumable wheel especially.- bunch of minor bugs, but mostly non- consequential. The only notable one for me: unfinishable sidequest (Biscuit)- you spend way too little time in Hogwarts. And the game encourages quicktravel and following the map blindly way too much.- accessibility settings aren't well thought out. I wanted to play without minimap and assistances to stop myself from mindlessly going from one world objective to the other, but there's not even a compass without the minimap...- Hogsmeade? More like Alohomeade. Seriously, there's nothing here other than shops and about 50 Alohomora 'Puzzles'- doesn't matter at all what house you play- this would've been better as a regular RPG focusing on Hogwarts and its immediate surroundings. With a regular character experiencing Hogwarts first time instead of all these grandiose plots. But its Warner Bros, so of course you're some random 5th year who just so happens to be the best wizard of all time. Excelling at everything the moment you touch it.  Oh and your magic is special too of course, no one else has it.- ... and of course you're the hero too, no choices on that matter, no dark path.",1
Fun game poor optimization.This trend is getting very annoying.I don't like paying $60-$70 for games day one too have issues.Adding denuvo to a game knowing it causes performance issues is poor business.Unfortuanetly i cant refund the game but never will i pre order or even pay full price for a game from wb?portkey.,1

boring,1
"Credit given to the developers that worked on graphics, map layout, and combat. Now to why I gave a thumbs down and do not recommend this game.The story and gameplay is like most new modern western games. Just soullessIts a hollow world, think of cyber punk and how the city just feels so empty its the same. With a trash story. The Npcs are soulless, the main characters there are none except some old guy. The story is really bad you somehow fighting and in the midst of a life and death situation and you have no clue why. The story is confusing some old guy has been with a goblin so you gotta fight their battles? Atleast in Harry Potter got the batman feel of someone killed the parents, this mc is just there with no back story.All npcs are void. You cant really make friendships or date any of the girls. I think Western games need to look at Jrpgs and take elements like Persona. Have doing these side quest give a reward like a date. Like why cant you date a girl, where are the cute girls?! There should be story lines with dating, have them be a part of the main quest save the damsel in distress. Nah instead ur helpin some old random guy for god knows why.Persona has you thinking like should I date and be loyal the cute girls finally here and once you finally start another hot girl comes along now its your decision be loyal, or go behind their back. Do you get caught or not you might loose this side character. Theres also no music, wheres the goosbump given music not even the original harry potter song can be heard. The loot system is terrible too, money dosnt matter theres a chest at every corner with a 200 coin worth vest or hat that increases your skill by 20 so your unstoppable. Again another western mechanic everything is handed down and not earned. Its so boring idk how people like that. Jrpgs you work for every item it makes it special and earned.Guess im just in culture shock seeing how great Japans games are then coming to this",1
please fix stuttering and FPS drop,1
"12 hours. Corrupted save file, cause why? no fucking reason. Game updates. Cloud saves fail for what ever reason. Cant recover them via steam cloud from 2 days ago because reason. Can see part of the cloud saves but no my actual game files. Now I've got to start again. FML.",1
Game is stuck for me after playing for 12+ hours; no matter what I do the character doesn't move. I don't want to load an old saved file and redo everything. Please devs stop releasing games to the public without proper testing.,1
"Gameplay is very good but unfortunately woke nonsense is rampant throughout!Ethnic minorities everywhere you look, be they the students or even the majority of the teachers - which would be fine if the game was set in the Bronx but its not!! This game is supposed to be set in 1800s Scotland!!!A tr@nny barmaid to cap it off and let's not forget woke dialog all throughout the game! Can't we even play a video game now without woke crap being thrust down our bloody throats?!Its a good game but for these reasons it does not deserve a thumbs up, these game creators need to wake the F*@# up and realise that we do not want this bull*@# in our games.",1
Performance issues make it unplayable to me...,1
"The game is awesome, but stuttering is ruining all of cutscenes and is quite immersion breaking. I will update this review once optimisation patch is deployed. To commend once again Callisto Protocol Dev team for fixing similar stuttering issue within days of the game's release.",1
"This Review is only because of bad performance. Game looks great, game run poorly. It is currently unoptimised. I am '' testing the game'' at this point.- 32 Go Ram 3200 cl16- Ryzen 5 3600 (6 /12)- RTX 3070 (8G VRAM)- 32 inch (LGGK650F-B) (144hz 1440 P)- Win 11- All Driver ( Bios, windows, AMD CPU and GPU Nvidia are all uptated to the most recent patch)Issue:- Game dip from 120 ish to 15 fps everything at low no ray tracing (because why use that?)- Immense Stutter- FPS drop even cap at 60 fps or uncap /  Vsync in Nvidia on / off in gameI got fully Refunded after (7.8 hour steam) (91 minutes in game stat) because, even there, steam acknowledged that this game at this state, is not playable '' For a lot of user with different build''.My friend is using Intel CPU and RTX 3060Ti and he have the same issue.*** ( My GF is using an old CPU. ''intel I7 6800k and GTX 1070'' and she got less issue then I have!)This Review will be updated to Recommended when it will be fully patch. ( maybe in 3 years like Cyberpunk)",1
"If you're someone who doesn't have the time to complete this game in one or two sittings then I can't recommend this game as it apparently has a very common issue with game saves. I'm the type of person who manual saves just to be sure and still had all my files corrupted, only four hours in. I cant trust the game to not do the same thing again so I guess for now I will have to wait for a patch to come out that fixes it or go through the customer support of warner bros to request a refund.also, the frame drops are still terrible, way worse then what Elden Ring had going on when it dropped, and I might not have the beefiest graphics card (RTX 3050) but for around half my playtime the textures and pop-in the game were so terrible it was more reminiscent of a playstation 2 game than a new gen game (which is apparently another bug). Really immersive breaking. A shame no one is talking about it.Absolutly game breaking bug. I can't recommend it to anyone in the state its in.",1
Fix your fucking game,1
"This game is amazing, the story and gameplay make you feel like you are truly living your own wizarding world adventure, however I do not recommend getting this on PC unless your PC is high end, an extremely good graphics card is required, the minimum specs that it says is bullshit. Im running a bottlenecked NVIDIA GTX 1070 with 16GB of ram and its borderline unplayable with all the frame drops even at lowest settings. The game itself gets a 10/10 from me, however my money was wasted getting it for PC. In fact, this game has single handedly made me want to stop PC gaming all together and just get a high end console like PS5.",1
"The game was interesting to begin with. So Ill start with my bad points:The loot is just plain boring, No exciting Drops,The rewards are boring (Merlin trails),The NPC's characters feel a lifeless, Very little enemy variety,Too many repetitive puzzles,Too many fetch and grab side quests,Performance is terrible even with very good hardware,Can map enough spells as its a console UI,Flying feels like a clunky after thought,Forced to be goodGood Points:Looks nice when performance does not tank,Decent world size to explore,Combat is fun,So decent spells,An okay main story just wish there was more choices,Changing Seasons as you progress the story (feels like time moves),Overall not worth buying the collector edition. I would wait for a sale before purchasing this game if your only looking for a time sync.",1
"The game is good but Denuvo make it unplayable, don't buy it, just wait for the cracked version without Denuvo.",1
"im playing ultra settting in 4k on an oled display and this game looks terrible. it looks like a year 2005 game. supeerrrrrrr disappointing. there is nothing magical about how this game looks, nohting even close to what the movies look like. its a really ugly and boring game to play. but hey, its 2023, what more can one expect other then garbage ",1
"Sh*t optimization. One of the unlucky ones whose game just keeps crashing and i tried every solution and still crashes. I give up , negative review <3 Fu harry potter",1
i couldnt recommend this mostly with $99 deluxe editionbought deluxe edition but the game was not what i expected. the first 2 hours was good. until the issues shows up. the fps drop all the time even i try in low mode graphics level. sync with controller was on and off sometimes. this could be amazing game but i dont think the system and implementation is there yet. i hope they could update it in next patch. this game have potential. but still a little bit disappointed with the issues and i cant recommend this mostly for deluxe editon after i spend $99 for it and came up with a lot of problems after 2 hours in the game and couldnt fix it even i tried every type of settings.,1

"Game runs pretty badly on a RTX 4090, huge stuttering. Some of the most dull and banal main character dialogue I've encountered in a game in many years. No innovative gameplay, you have played this game in some form many times already. Get it if it's $40 and you have absolutely nothing else to play",1
The performance is terrible. FPS can drop all the way from 150 to below 20 for no reason on RTX 3080.,1
"i so wanted this to compare to a game made 8 years ago (witcher 3) . This game did have some aspects of the witcher 3 but failed short on achieving versatility.  Legendary items are as common as greens. HL Doesn't really look good even on ultra settings. The reality is, games designed for consoles really limit the overall customizations of pc users. The keyboard layout is just nuts , trying to hit CTRL to doge and F3 for a combo spell switch without breaking your fingers is just not well thought out. Don't forget about keeping yourself healed too. oh well, just grind to fin",1
It keeps crashing.,1
"This review may change to a Yes with patches to improve performance and lighting bugs, but in its current state, it has too much stuttering and ray traced lighting pop-in, even with an RTX 4090. The game itself is brilliantly detailed with phenomenal combat and a good storyline, yet there is too much killing and enemy encounters in the open world to really feel like a 16-year-old Hogwarts student wandering the Wizarding World. The constant killing hampers the immersion and makes this just like another other generic open world RPG when not actively in a story mission.",1
"Literally just lost DAYS of work on this game.  Seriously, devs??",1

Should have been better. Latest patch broke the game and erased all my saves.,1

Every time i boot it up it crashes,1
great story runs like garbage i have a it in 1920 x 1080 resolution on the lowest settings and still get only a max of 40 fps in areas devoid of things to load. i have a Geforce Nvidia RTX 3060  12gigs vram ands an Intel I7-10700F 32 gigs DDR4 of memory so should be able to run like 60+ fps on 2560 x 1440 resolution like i can for most of my games so cant recommend until this is fixed,1
"2 days worth of data was deleted i saved and left as usual exit to windows, i come back after work to find out all my data was gone all my excitement is gone and i don't wanna play it anymore i heard so much good stuff about the game but this just ruins it for me to get that far and have my data corrupted",1
"the exploration is fine but the combat to this game is fucking dog shit, the color coded shielding thing is so fucking stupid. the dodge and shielding mechanics for your character are fucking redundant, and they made the prompts have no windup on hard, they swarm the shit out of you with enemies in every encounter when this game isnt fucking spiderman. the reason everyone is using the curses is because they literally bypass the retarded shielding mechanic. the story was instantly ""meh"" to me once they introduced ""ancient magic"" and its  literally as generic as u can possibly name something and then they clearly made it as this video gamey ultimate ability that 1 hits shit. i would honestly rather have another story about the phylocipher stone than this shit tbh. theres no quidditch, no daigon alley, no phylocipher stone/Flamel and no founder items (aka the sword of  gryffindor or the diadem of raven claw). admittedly this is very nit picky but the layout of everything in the game is off, gryffindor common room isnt on the moving stairs and forbidden forest isnt by hagreds hut.severely disappointed with this game",1
"Pros: -The best thing this game has going for it are the visuals. -transmog-nostalgia I guessCons:-the story/ writing is absolute garbage, npc's always have the most asinine commentary imaginable-tons of immersion breaking things are just never addressed, like the fact that the pc is a straight up murder hobo and has incredibly blaze reactions to killing hundreds of people in spite of being a teenage student who supposedly only just found out about being a wizard 2 weeks before the game starts? -the side quests are super repetitive/ boring, most are just fetch or kill quests-everything in the open world is just a handful of copy pasted encounters-the combat has a decent flow but it's undermined by the lack options for building out your character and lack of difficulty, not to mention all the cheesy 1 shot strats (stealth 1h kos almost everything for some reason for example)-npcs often stutter around and glitch out-a number of potentially cool game systems were seemingly added as an afterthought, maybe with mods things like flying mounts, gear upgrades, and crafting could be engaging but in their present state there's barely any reason to bother and some are just frustratingly clunky-the tutorial takes 10 real life years to complete-J.K. Rowling",1
"The performance issues aside, I""m going to focus on the actual game here. It's a Ubisoft openworld game in a Harry Potter wrapper. The quests are the same and completely forgettable. Instead of collecting 5 books, you'll be collecting 5 stones for the next one. The biggest hindrance being lifeless NPCs. No seriously, NPCs do not respond to you at all. You walk up to them, nothing. You cast a spell on them, nothing. It's as if you are walking through a pensive.  The side characters have zero emotion, it's as if the voice actors are simply reading their lines. The castle is well designed however, lots of attention to detail. The combat has a bit of depth to it and is fun. If a childhood dream is to simply walk through the halls of hogwarts, you'll like it. Do not expect a lively school, cause it ain't that at all.",1

Game is boring.,1
"The problem starts when you see people ""Recommending"" the Game on Steam but complaining about the performance..We know that the game is amazing, but the poor optimization and the low fps discourage playing, the impression it gives is that Avalanche Software made the game for those who have Playstation 5 or Xbox, for those who have a Nasa PC it was only 1 bonus . .After years waiting for the release of Hogwarts Legacy, this resource-drinking turtle is released. The update that came out on the 14th made it slower, if they improve I'll change this review.",1

"So... I love this game. I really do...But man...The PC performance has been an absolute dumpster fire for me. I keep pushing on due to loving the game. I am starting to go insane...That being said, what a great game in premise. For the love of everything holy, please, pretend to the optimize this game. I have a good CPU and a RTX 2070 Super...I meet requirements. There are 0 reasons this game should run terribly for me.I beg you... please fix it. I will change the review when you do.",1
"The quests, dialogue, and rewards for doing anything were too repetitive, tacked on RPG mechanics that serve no purpose, a severe lack of freedom with spellcasting systems. This game was targeted towards a casual audience that I guess I'm not a part of - I expected more given the rave reviews.",1
"Looks like a good game but unplayable at its current state with all the stuttering, maybe buy when it's on sale",1

fix this horrid optimization for pc. ,1

"More like HogSHIT Legacy, nothing good to say about this game, this is why gaming has gown down hill. Positive reviews on an absolute dogshit game, horrible optimization, planned DLC. What is wrong with you normie fucking retards? Go play candy crush and battle royal, stop positiviely reviewing objectively terrible games. These companis are laughing at you. Let the lgbtq WEIRDO community have it, you deserve eachother.",1
"why are there no heavy people in this game i see no larger students whether it be a female male or fluid. in my opinion based on the values of J.K i think maybe this was a planned feature to alienate a second type of person. bad enough that there is no Fluid gender option, you also now cant change you size in game and have to be some skinny kid not a time accurate fatty",1
"After about 35 hours I'm 50% through the story, and just bored out of my mind.  The game has great graphics, music, atmosphere, etc.  But after a while the game-play just becomes very mundane.  I doubt I'll finish it.",1
Poop turds,1
"If they allow you to disable gameplay hints for puzzles, I will gladly change this. I'm tired of having every puzzle in the game spoiled because this game only wants to give you 5 seconds to solve it.",1
Do not buy this game. This game wont let you be a evil wizard. Rated T for sofTys only buy  this. Horrible main story line. This game is for people who get offended by  gender.,1
They need to fix the issues with the performance issues of the game plus the black screen after the loading session,1
Game kept auto locking onto the final boss while fighting causing me to not be able hit his orbs so I could do actually do damage. Also since I was stuck locked on to him at the last part of the fight I kept dodging and because my guys was locked on facing forward I could only move forward right into the boss so then he'd kill me. I have lock on unbounded and it still locks on and makes not be able move around freely.,1
"It's a good game and all, just poorly optimized for pc. Also the devs lazily put a mans voice over the tavern woman, so the game is kinda rushed as well. I can't recommend a game where it breaks immersion putting the wrong gender's voice over a npc, it just sounds horrible and looks uncanny.",1
"Just don¢¥t! Shallow, empty, no brain needed. Wasted opportunity at best.",1
"Can't give it a thumbs up until they fix the performance. Stuttering like crazy while in combat or just strutting around hogwarts. One second Im getting 144 fps and then WHAM, Im down to 20. Sometimes I can't lock onto enemies or the lock on indication just disappears. Once they can fix these issues this would be a fun game to play but right now I just frustrating. I would get a refund if I honestly could",1
"If i were to rate this game on it's story and game play only i would say it is great. But sadly as good as the game play and story of this game is for what i have been through the performance is so bad in areas of the game like when in the castle or the small town that is near by seriously takes away from the enjoyment of the game. When you go from 100+ fps all the way down to 80-30 fps it hurts...I think the worst for me is the stuttering that happens, it is so hard on my eyes like yikes....I really hope this gets sorted out soon because i truly think this would be such a fun game to play if it was smooth all the time. I would highly recommend waiting to get this game on PC till a fix is made for the performance problems. I just want to make clear the only reason i am giving this a bad ratting is based on the bad performance. My PC specs belowGPU: 3080CPU: i7 8700RAM: 32 Gigs",1
Boring open world trope filled game with a Harry Potter skin. Combat is okay I guess,1
british people,1
game lags way to much.wanna keep playing but its not playable,1

too much talking,1
Yet another Developer that thinks it's alright to release a poorly optimized game for PC. Honestly so sick and tired of greedy companies releasing an unplayable game. Its been 5 days since official release fix the god damn game already and keep us up to date on what's going on,1
still havent learned any curses 10/10 would recommend,1
"The game starts you off in an introduction area which is simply put the tutorial stage of the game. After this, you are taken to hogwarts, where you are immediately met with terrible framerates and clearly a poorly optimised game for PC'S. I have a 3070 Ti, and was having framerate issues even on medium settings which, comparatively to RDR2, I can get ultra high with no issues. In this current state of the game, I would not recommend it if you are looking for a smooth gameplay experience. I have gotten a refund and will not be playing until the devs can sort our this poor optimisation issue.",1
"This game keeps crashing. Almost unplayable, at minimum very very annoying!",1
game crashed booted it back up my save was gone 17 hrs gone,1
"Like going on a date with someone extremely attractive with absolutely no interests or anything to talk about, Hogwarts legacy has both gameplay and characters that are extremely shallow. At 16 hours in, it feels similar to being halfway through season 2 of a Netflix series and waiting for it to get good enough to justify the time I've spent. None of the characters are worth remembering and the plot tries extremely hard to be convoluted. Even on the hardest difficulty, the combat boils down to staring at your character to dodge when your character lights up (indicating you're about to be hit) and then button mashing.If you're a fan of beautiful graphics and a diehard Harry Potter fan, this game may be for you. Otherwise, if you're looking for an engaging story and deep/immersive gameplay, stay away.",1
I usually don't write reviews but had to here so I pre ordered this and gameplay is great played it for 2 days.  tried to play it again and now it's not launching the game for me at all all my drivers everything is up to date deleted the folder and everything still won't load. which is why I have to get refund on it,1
I may have played this a lot - but I¡¯m still extremely dissapointed. This game has absolutely zero depth.,1
Wish I can cast repario on this game and make it run better,1
I can't recommend the game until they fix performance issues of stuttering and crashing. I'll update my review once they patch it.,1
"As great as the main story and most ""relationship line"" major side stories are, the world is utterly empty for the most part, there is ZERO ""I'm a student at Hogwarts"" gameplay outside of 1 or 2 short cutscenes per class, that's it.Your choice of house doesn't matter one bit, your dialogue and behaviour choices are always the exact same no matter if you're Slytherin or Hufflepuff.Using the Dark Arts? No one cares... you can literally cast Avada Kedavra right IN FRONT of your professors, and they do not even react, let alone cause you any consequences whatsoever.Hogwarts itself, while visually impressive to be sure, has zero point zero percent ""Sentient Castle"" feel... nothing... there aren't even the iconic moving staircases... they only fade in and out visually, but they are nonetheless 100% static, always connecting the same point A to the same point B.Room of Requirement also is a major letdown, as it has zero roleplaying value, it is simply a room full of resource nodes, and the Vivaria are just the same... sure, for a few minutes it might be nice to watch a Hippogriff young offspring frolick about, but that's all you're getting... the animals themselves are also just glorified resource nodes, all you can do is brush, feed, harvest, repeat ad nauseam.The stuff you can summon both in RoR and Vivaria is also just scene dressing... if you were thinking of actually entering that Cottage you spawned in your Vivarium, think again.... if you thought you could sit down on those comfy chairs you just summoned, think again.Same with everything outside of the RoR as well... think you could go to the Great Hall, sit down at your House Table and eat, interact with friends/NPCs of your house, etc? Think again.The few things Hogwarts Legacy does well, it does really well... but everything else, and especially the ending of the main story, where your choices make zero difference, with there not even being any Epilogue to speak of... it all feels very rushed, and the game pretty much in all aspects aside from Main and ""Relationship Line"" story fails utterly to live up to the potential that is there in abundance.On top of all that, there's the abysmal technical state affecting a huge number of players even on 4090-level gaming rigs, and the fact that the game is massively shorter than what the devs promised... if I hadn't gotten it for free, I would've honestly refunded it, or otherwise felt majorly taken for a ride.Given that the game puts our ""Legacy"" so front and center, there's very little communication thereof while you play the game... for the most part, there are literally ZERO consequences to your actions, it simply doesn't matter what you do or don't do, if you use the Unforgivable Curses or not, not even what you decide during the crucial final minutes of the story... and as I said above, there isn't even any proper Epilogue, nothing to actually show you how your choices changed the world around you, i.e. what your ""Legacy"" actually would be.Nothing at all. And that leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste... so much wasted potential... this game could have been a true masterpiece... as it stands, I cannot in good conscience recommend it for full price.",1
garbage,1
"Freg...This game is so cookie cutter game, yet I am forcing myself to play because I paid full price.When will I ever learn - stop playing AAA titles...they are nothing but disappointments.Wait for a sale.",1
I love this game i recommend it a lot the problom is that it is so buggy i soft lock my game 10 times and i can not get past the 3 trial cus the game will not do the cutseen so i can not play the game,1
5 hours in and ive crashed 3 times along with tons of graphical issues. Games really slow and 80% of what you do is sit and watch cutscenes.,1
This game is so mid,1
"This game is amazing but they still not fix drop fps yet. So i'm sorry, i will refund this game. I buy again and change review after drop fps and stuttering get fix. Thanks",1
mid,1
Great until I lost my 17 hour save after a crash and the game doesn't exactly have enough variety in choices to make me want to start over. Such a shame because I was really enjoying it,1
"Whatever they ""patched"" completely made the game an unplayable stuttery mess. absolutely not worth it.",1
"If you're not a fan of Harry Potter, this game doesn't really have anything new and fun to add to the table. The game seemed to be marketed as some sort of RPG, but it has incredibly little in the way of good actual RPG elements (like a compelling story with choices that affect it). There are lots of side quests of different sorts of puzzles, but there are tons and tons of them. The map is quite big and scenic, but it's all rather repetitive- for example, there are probably 15-20 villages, but there is very little to distinguish them. Also, as far as side characters, they completely disappear from the game once you've done their side quest. It would be nice if there were more activities to do with the characters that are supposed to be your friend, but there are almost none. Also, I'll be the millionth person to say that a Harry Potter game not having quidditch is one of the biggest misses imaginable. Growing up as a huge fan of Harry Potter, it was basically my favorite thing to imagine myself doing. They put a lot more effort into a system of growing plants, making potions, and tending to animals. The animal system is very in depth, but not terribly exciting as far as Harry Potter goes. Wouldn't it make more sense to find the animals, catalog them, rather than capture them and keep them in your pen? The combat system was heavily criticized online, but I think it's one of the thing about the game that was done quite well. I think once you learn a few spells, it gets quite fun. The dodging can be a little clunky, but the comboing feels very fluid and interesting. Some of the criticisms about the antisemitism in the story seem a little sensationalized, but I definitely think there are several elements to the story that are amiss (the bad guys are fighting for... equality?) sometimes once your character clears out a Goblin camp, they will say something like ""It's too late for you to change your ways!"" which sounds a little dark, and doesn't help the games image. On the plus side, at least, the inclusion of Sirona Ryan is a nice touch. It's a nice gesture by the game creators to have a transgender character who is an important part of the story, and an interesting character to boot. Still, I can't get it out of my head that one of the goblins says, ""I agree with you, violence isn't the answer!"" to the leader of the goblins, which is an incredibly milquetoast, neoliberal vision of the world. I suppose that fits with JK Rowling's style, much to the detriment of this game. Like I said, if you're a Harry Potter fan, it's probably worth playing. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this to RPG fans at all.",1
"Fun combat 2/5, puzzles too ez 2/5, shit main story 1/5, nice views tho 3,5/5. Overall fucking cringe. Felt like autist Cristopher Robin while petting those little cute monsters. Not worth it if you are grown man and not retarded",1
Please help the games isn't opening,1
Can't tell you how good the game is because its currently unplayable due to stuttering! Avoid until they patch  it.,1
even with a good computer lag is unreal,1
games poorly optimized needs to be updated ASAP,1
all my data was wiped at leval 30 now i need to restart i need help,1
"I love this game and its so nice, but the stuttering, and big fps drops, mainly happening inside the castle, are giving me a head ache, like seriously they affect me, like nausea or something.. every time i try go through a door in Hogwarts is giving me this feeling .. Please fix :(",1
"landscapes look good, minor bugs, repetitive gameplay, low mob/enemy variety, too easy/spamy combat, dull dialogues(I only liked Sebastian and Ominis other NPCS were lifeless so I started skipping a lot), weird XP system that enforces you to 100% the game if you want to hit 40, the ""puzzles"" were fun in the beginnung but were too easy/boring in the long run. lame antagonist/bossfight in the end. overall it was fun/a decent game but not worth the 70¢æ tbh. get it when its on sale and theres more content. 7/10 game if you have nothing else to play at best more like 6/10. I played it on Hard and 240fps average on ultra my system is 13900k+4090 etc.",1
"Sorry, but the Story sucks. It is linear and has nothing to do with RPG. You barely get a choice and most of your actions have no weight. The game is full of plot holes...",1
Game crashes quite a bit and will no longer launch at all.,1
"The game is constantly crashing. Sometimes it crashes in a few minutes of gameplay and sometimes it crashes in under an hour, but it always crashes in the end. I've tried every fix that I've found online, but nothing works. This is the only game in recent memory where it's crashed at all.",1
"Run very bad and stuttery in my PC setup: Ryzen 5 3600 + RTX3070, on every setting level (low, med, high, even ultra)To the point where it became cinematic below 24FPS in some early cutscenes.Really want to love this game.Great game but bad optimization for me.Refunded for now, probably will buy it back later after several updates and a discounted price.Not worth the price when I can't even enjoy a decent experience.",1
problems installing then problems updating waste of time,1
"The game is good on so many things, but worse in alot more. I have enjoyed my time, but i dont want this kind of RPG attitude to become the standard because ""hey, 93% of steam didnt think our game sucked, and gave it the thumbs up"" to be a metric of a good game. Do better next time.",1
"(Please read the bottom for the reason for thumbs down.)Hogwarts Legacy went beyond my expectations when coming from a studio that, on the surface, only looks like they made bad mobile games. It's extremely fun with a spell combination system for magic that encourages mixing and trying different spells to excel in combat and parrying. Everything is flashy and interesting. The visual design and effects of the world and world is exciting. The first time you walk on moving stairs is a treat.Honestly, I only have surprised praises for how good this game came to be.So I will only list two complaints since you probably have a good idea how great the rest of this open-world RPG is. There are two major things holding it back. The first is easilyPerformance.Due to some questionable coding in Unreal Engine, the optimization of this game likes to violently shake from working smooth as butter and other times it can drop even lower than 15 fps. When this happens seems to be random as some areas in Hogwarts run perfectly fine and then will absolutely start to stutter. Same with the forests, towns, they seem to start to fail to run well at most times. Going into your menus and back into the gameplay seems to 50/50 fix this. Normally this isn't a big deal, although it will sometimes start happening when transitioning into a cutscene which kind of completely ruins the immersion or care when it looks that bad.Other, more important times, is where a scene or moment transitions into combat and it happens. Times and paying attention are important the game stuttering heavily to 15 fps doesn't feel good.My other complaint is that there doesn't seem to be enough for replay value. Now, this isn't such a big deal since the game is massive and has lots to do. Though, it seems like the original design had more planned for it and seems strange when playing and seeing that one playthrough wont be different from any other. Most of your choices are aesthetic only and that's not speaking of character creation. Things like choosing your house to your wand creation have no impact really on story or how you play. The wand aspect was a huge disappointment for me as it meant, no matter what, every play through of the game would feel exactly the same in combat. It feels like taking out a personal touch of freedom and creativity is impacted on you when you will be using the same spells and basic attacks in the same fashion no matter what.As well, story elements are essentially the same on multiple playthroughs. There isn't impactful choices or a morality system so however you play will always result to Point A to the ending Point B. This isn't a major issue, but seems quite strange that a game that allows you to make your own character with many choices of creation, equipement design, and everything else combined is relegated on a monorail style of character personality and story. It is pretty linear and the linearity is felt stronger the longer you play. It also doesn't help that choices that are there are meaningless. Learning forbidden magic, wand creation, and dialogue have little to no change at all. Although the illusion of meaning is there, it feels a little disappointing that it is shallow.Overall, though, the game itself is large with lots to do and a Harry Potter story that actually feels engaging and interesting. Characters are great albeit there DOES feel like a slight disassociation from you and your classmates and doesn't give this perspective of your bonding or knowing these people. They just happen to be around and talk to you when you're needed. Which serves what it needs to do. It just damages their roles as being written as characters while making you feel more detached as a person yourself if it doesn't relate to you being a great magic user with special powers. Luckily, this is overshadowed by the rest of the world. Everything related here is mostly nitpicks that, if paid attention to, could make it feel like a perfect game. Yet these little small faults here and there just hold it back at just being ""Great"" and that is by no means a bad thing.((EDIT: Currently due to optimization, most PCs even on the high end have performance issues that happen at any and every point at random. They are massive FPS drops that can even occur at moments of combat and available guides/fixes require having to do changes beyond just the built in setting's menu such as altering .ini files. This is not an acceptable state to have your game in and these performance issues negatively impacting both regular experience as well as the challenges of puzzles/combat in order to progress can be game breaking for some. Changing settings from Higher/Lower does not affect this and some have stated specifically explained how exactly the game creates large memory leaks at these given points. This game is fantastic, but I can't recommend it until this is fixed. Especially since what DOES work functions extremely well on even medium/low end PCs.))",1
"Everyone my age grew up loving Harry Potter. I remember waiting for the new books to come out, reading them in a week, and then talking about them with my friends and teachers for months. The movies were the highlight of my childhood. I was waiting for a game like this.Not like this. Every aspect of the environment and story was hacked to bits, flayed alive to be sacrificed on the altar of diversity, inclusion, and equity. DIE, it did. 1850's Britain, and there are open lesbians walking around in broad daylight? The ministry of magic, who reports to queen Victoria, the head of the Anglican church, can not possibly be unaware of homosexuality in Hogwarts and the surrounding villages. Transexual bartenders when medical theory was based on miasma? Most people could not survive giving birth, much less replacing sexual organs. Which is more magical; performing a surgical transplant on the genitalia, or surgically transplanting 2023 twitter culture into 1850's Britain? I'm sad that creativity has died, and from it's grave sprung cold political idealism and rote mantras of political alignment.As a game, it's nothing special. Nothing like the Witcher 3, which surpasses visually, mechanically, and thematically. If this game had anything going for it, it was nostalgia. Nostalgia cannot be maintained with such a fierce barrage of modern political indoctrination.For the leftists: i understand that you must now attack me, for the sake of acceptance of your tribe. If you don't, they will question your loyalty. Please start your comment with an ***, so that you can get your public proof of loyalty, and I don't have to waste my time.",1
Game deleted itself after saying it was updating. I got got,1

it says i have 4 hours of play time invested in the game. truth is that's 4 hours of crashing on loading screen. as an avid gamer for 20 years i expect a few bugs here & there but this is too much. i have scoured the internet & tried fix after fix & still no luck.  I would say save your money till it's better optimized for PC.,1
mid,1
blew up my pc,1
The current state of the game is unplayable with constant FPS drops and poor framerate everywhere.,1
"Had to refund, game was unplayable and poorly optimised from freezing and stuttering to deleting save files, you would think the game was coded on scratch.",1
"Potion making doesn't feel ""magical"" whatsoever. Lockpicking does not pause the game and you learn this the hard way. 30% of my time I've spend spamming Revelio to figure where a scroll sound comes from rather than actually playing the game.Game has a lot of lore and details for Potterheads, but falls a bit short on innovations and gameplay.",1
:),1
"Badly optimise. Low fps.If you like Harry potter...you might enjoy this game...but just like the movie, i found that I am pushing myself to finish it off....because i paid for it..I would say, grab this game on sale, at 60-75%....everything seems bland on that game...",1
"The first few hours are okay. The lustre wears off quickly. It's pretty woke.I would suggest waiting for a DEEP discount, like <$20.",1
Broke the mission to pick up the cookie. I opened the lock on the cage before the start of the side quest and during the quest I couldn't open the lock to let them out because there was no lock,1
L game you cant avada-kedavra fellow classmates,1
The game deleted my save file after 7 hours. The performance is absolutely terrible.,1
game is trash side quests are boring ash and barely pve in game dont waste almost 100$,1
"Puzzles in this game are fun, the combat really sucks. Targeting is a joke, which really ruins combat. Time consuming and buggy to change target during battle. Spells cast at enemies who are not targeted. Amazing this game was released with this kind of a problem.",1
"After 23 hours, my save game loads, get frozen and nothing. Shame",1
"game runs like absolute shite for some reason on my pc despite having a 3060 and 5600x playing at 1080p low settings. massive fucking fps drops when im just tryna play the game. makes combat almost unplayable at points and is overall shit when it comes to being optimised for pc. like fuck sake, i surely dont need to spend more money on my computer just to be able to play a game at above 60 fps consistently. sort that shit out and ill give it a positive review cause everything else about the game is good. but its almost fucking unplayable on my pc",1
"I love the game in almost all its aspects, however after the latest update of the game it has broken the performance to the extreme. I was playing it on High with some options on Ultra, but after the update, I can't play the game even on medium settings. For this alone, I do not recommend the game at least until it is fixed, now it is unplayable.",1
Boring world filled with too many pointless collectables.,1
"Its not my style, if all you want to do is run around and collect things for 50 hours, its your game. there's less than 30 spells that you just run around spamming mindlessly, and it seems they made the world map absolutely massive for no reason other than making you run around more. everyone has their thing, this one is not for me apparently.",1
"I have mixed feeling about this game...One one hand it is simply a piece of art. On the other, it plays like hot garbage.This is one of the most poorly optimized games I have ever played. It doesn't matter how powerful a computer you own or even how low you crank your settings. The game constantly stutters and it is a HUGE immersion breaker. Buy this game in a year once they have hopefully patched it enough to actually run.",1
"They didnt do shit, It WAS playable I got 90fps in the village, not Hogsmade this other small, I didnt had any textures flicks, and ofc there were some stutters after changing location but it was playable, NOW after UPDATE its much WORSE. 45fps in the same location, and stuttering everywhere. I love HP books, and movies. Even bought this game as soon it was pre-relased and it was FUN, and hype for it UNTIL now. It's over. Time to wait for future update with hopeless that there gonna be atleast good. SHAME",1
Game runs like shit. I want a refund. I'll wait to buy when this game is sub $20 in a year,1
Unplayable always crashes,1
most crashy and buggy game ive ever played. the game play is fun sure but half the time i cant enjoy the game because its either crashing or i cant unlock something anymore because of a crash. My pc is not bad its actually top of the line and it still crashes. i tried everything to get this game running without crashing but nothing worked.Pc specs:i9-13900k3080ti32gb of ram ddr5overclocks turned off to see if that was causing crashes but didnt solve anything,1
It's a good looking gameOverly long tutorialUnusual way to get most experienceClunky combat for pc and casting the reveal spell all the time sucksMultiple crashes and bugs and now the game won't launch after patchI want to like it more but I'll give it a 5/10 for now.It'll get better but it is better to wait a while to let them get some decent patches out.,1
"I have completed the story 14 missions total, several of them with some blocks that forced me to complete secondary content. While most people had terrible performance and is true that in my case I also had bad moments with it, I was able to complete it in 19h.Honestly the story is quite simple, the stakes are there but it really doesn't feel good and every dialogue choice doesn't really matter on the development of the main story only how the individual dialogue develops.Performance is even after the patch, not great. I had big stretches where I was able to play at 60 fps at 3440x1440 (ultrawide) with most settings at ultra, a few on high and DLSS at quality. But i had several drops to the 40fps and many to the 50-55fps with quick recovery. I believe most developers nowadays are trusting in technologies like DLSS and FSR to carry them the rest of they way and skip on optimisation. Sadly this is not the way in my honest opinion as a developer myself.The game clearly needed more thought and time. We know the first impression is important and this game is only selling because the IP it carries. It is fun to play for a bit, it makes feel like a wizard yes, but sadly it becomes monotonous towards the middle and is just tedious towards the end. Cooldowns in this case are more annoying than anything else, you base damage can be improved but towards the end many big enemies take forever to take down without the actual spells. Some missions have spells requirements which I understand as they are needed for completing certain sections but level requirements are useless on the easier difficulties. I can easily deal with a dozen enemies 1 or 2 levels above me and it won't matter. At least if your spells and attacks are combined right and your are playing on the easiest difficulty.Again, the game is not bad. I really don't care about the drama about JK. I don't care about seeing more black people. I don't care the sexuality some characters.  I care about the work and this work is currently average for me and for many people is quite unplayable. So no. I don't recommend it. Wait until the performance is fixed and it is on sale. Perhaps then you will be able to enjoy it better.",1

Game breaking bugs. i'm close to just uninstalling and never playing it again.,1
Game Black Screens on launch. No official Nvidia drivers. $80 down the drain and cant even play.,1
"Great idea - bad implementation.Pre-ordered this, deluxe edition an all. Game comes out, terrible performance despite my machine vastly exceeding the requirements. Horrible FPS in hallways in the school and just about every cut scene no matter if the graphics are set to Ultra or Minimum. Can't play so I wait. Devs patch the game saying performance should be better. I load the game back up, issues still present. I quit the game. And wait some more. Another patch - performance issues supposedly patched again. Load the game back up once more....still the same issues. I'm done. I returned this game for a full refund. 0/10. I'm not playing this game with the devs.",1
"I will start with - this is the first and last game I have ever pre-ordered. I was so hyped about the game after all these years - a Harry Potter game with modern graphics. I will point out the bad sides first. 1. The game is dashingly predictable. The story is boring (SPOILERS!!!), I am the ultra young hero that defeated and killed wizards with muuuch more experience than me. Sure. Booooring. 2. I start from 5th year and I miss all the fun from the beginning, all the spell learning, classes, etc. 3. Every single NPC besides the ones for the quests, feel like the training dummies I test my magic on. They do not feel living, they kinda just stay there, like cardboard characters. 4. This should must've been a MMORPG game, where we start from 1st year, learn, duel each other, form teams, eventually story unwinds that Hogwarts will be attacked eventually, we participate in different events where we learn newer and newer stuff, the years go by, we get better and better, whole game goes darker, more enemies spawn, attack us, lure us, etc. Eventually we get to a point where we have to defend Hogwarts and if we fail - then we have to retake it. All of us should've had our own paths, become herbalists, beast masters, potion maters, etc, fight with what we chose, explore the world, gather, learn. Have different character personalities - like being bad or arrogant, or good, or selfish, etc. 6. Game becomes repetitive fast, especially with all the cut scenes that you cannot cancel (like Merlin trials) - it gets annoying. 7. The whole world feels... small. Yes, there's lots to explore, but it gets the same after some time. Spiders, inferni, some water enemies and loalists. That's it. Few trolls and few wolves. 8. The game is badly optimized for PC, it works, but it requires a lot of hardware to be ran on maximum graphics where you do not get much better graphics, to be honest. 9. Conversations are dull, you cannot make proper conversation, it's very straightforward and there are ""choices"" that do not affect anything of the end game. 10. All the teachers are bad copy from the teachers of the HP saga, visually and character like. 11. If it was a 10$ game - it would be okay. But 50-70$ game - it's definitely not worth the money,Overall - meh. It's playable, it's just not what it could've been - a masterpiece. Now it's just another game we will forget in several months.",1
"At the moment, I recommend holding off as performance is quite choppy even on various high end systems. Actual game is fun to explore and whatnot, but the current performance is dismal.",1
Fucking game deleted my saves. Don't buy it.,1

"Unfortunately, at this state the game is just unplayable. The game is stuttering nonstop and it's almost unplayable. I will change the review when it will be fixed.",1
game stutters way too much,1
flawed aiming system that needs to be fixed makes the game unplayable when battling multiple enemies the system wont change targets and will stay locked on target when not even in target lock it needs to be fixed like now!!!!!,1
shit,1
"ultra woke you can make transgender wizard but also there is trans gender npcs, refunding game based on religious values, cannot support ultra woke gaming",1
"After seeing people comparing this with Elden Ring i wanted to say few things. This game doesn't give feeling of exploration at all. Just spam Revelio all the way and you will find what you looking for. Total of 16 spells or so you can use against vass majority of spells and builds in elden ring. So on and so forth. But i will just hit the game from various points. The optimization is quite bad at the moment although it can and maybe will be fixed with some patches. First of all this is not a Role Playing game at all. Forcing a player to read through all dialogues doesn't make it a RPG. You cannot do things you want to do, its just about linear quests. For example you dont have to go to sleep to finnish a day you can just skip time. You cant go to the breakfast and receive daily mail with the owls etc. To learn a spell from a class you simply can click on skip time or wait till the professor will appear and just go through dialogue. You have option to grow some plants and make own potions although you can grow a plant with real time option. After i saw 10 minute mark on a plant i just gave up on that option immediately. Chamber of secrets just about a revelio spell and page that comes from it, can't explore the depths of Hogwarts its a shame. You start as a 5th year but 1st year student knows more spells than you know yourself, i mean to learn Expelliarmus i have to use successful dodge 10 times and cast 3 times incendio. The castle feels literally the same, its like i'm walking through same corridors and doing almost same things, and the castle literally feels so small. Some details are very good though, like the pot of polyjuice potion in one of the bathrooms that has only door that can be opened. The changing staircase hall is very small and has the worst spinning staircase design that feels like shopping mall. Mostly the castle is about staircases to go somewhere you should climb too much spinning staircases. Other than that you fighting goblins doing some quests and having some inventory space makes game even more annoying because the game is offline game for which inventory space even shouldn't be an option. There is no Quidditch, as old harry potter games had it and even one game was dedicated to Quidditch that shouldn't be that hard to make. EDIT 1 : I think they will bring quidditch anyway because of some lame excuse of professor black that someone injured badly and they just cancelled for time being, means DLC will be quidditch related to squeeze some more money. Overall in my opinion this game is not worth its price and honestly i wouldn't return to play it over again.",1
"[h1]Gameplay[/h1] [b][[/b]8.5[b]/10][/b]+ Very immersive to the world it wants to portray, with a few liberties taken to smooth out the experience.+ World and map design is solid.+ Save points are managed fairly well.- A lot of the content is Ubisoft-level collect-a-thon garbage.~ Puzzles in the game range from interesting to tedious.~ Characters are decently voiced, but very bland lines are used. Fitting, yet soulless.~ Their attempt to inject certain character archetypes (the wokeness, as some might call it) is there, poorly implemented and quite unfulfilling, but points for the effort, I suppose.[h1]Combat[/h1] [b][[/b]7.5[b]/10][/b]+ Clever ways of introducing the myriad of spells of the series.- Enemy variety is lacking, but for the sake of immersion, understandable.~ The actual combat itself can be janky and a bit too shallow.[h1]Story/Dialogue[/h1] [b][[/b]3[b]/10][/b]+ A lot of effort is put into voicing the characters- Strong dialogue is not a thing here. Occasional cringe.- I might change these next parts later, but the overall story (so far) is immensely unsatisfying.- The illusion of 'choice' that you have in this game is as expected.- The context of having a student going around murdering bandits and killers is... something.- As someone who once enjoyed the books and has/had a weak sense of imagination, still disappointed.[h1]Audio/Visuals/Theme[/h1] [b][[/b]9[b]/10][/b]+ Visual design is on par with any major release of the recent years.+ Absolutely amazing soundtrack and audio, though Hogsmeade's bgm needs some tuning.+ Immersion is the highest of any product of the series, barring its source.+ Plentiful cosmetic options, though perhaps a toggle wardrobe might be nice.[h1]Performance[/h1] [b][[/b]2[b]/10][/b]- The recommended specs are a hit/miss. I got a miss.- There are bugs. There are a sizeable number of bugs. Most not too game-breaking. Most.- F off with Denuvo.~ For how it looks, it's understandable there's issues.

No.+ Does buying the game mean you are supporting the anti-trans shenanigans of JK? Yes.+ Does buying this game mean you aren't a supporter of trans rights? No, but 'supporter' might be a strong word.

Not a bad time, but if you're not a fan of the series or have any interest in it, what you gain from this game is similar to another Assassin's Creed title.By rights, still a good game, but I don't rate anything in a vacuum. Once the issues are ironed out (hopefully) and the game goes on sale, I'd recommend it if you're looking for a decent collect-a-thon to eat up your time.",1
"This is possibly the most poorly optimized game I've ever purchased on Steam. The first section of the game performed fine, likely because the environments aren't all that elaborate and there isn't much foliage. The devs cleverly designed this portion to take up the majority of Steam's 2 hour maximum play time before a refund is not allowed. I have 5 hours play time and I believe about an hour and a half of that was spent trying to get the game to work properly with no luck. (yes I tried lowering the settings, among other fixes). My PC can run Elden Ring and RDR2 with no issues so it isn't my build.Taking even a single step in any direction Hogwarts or Hogsmeade causes severe stuttering and frame drops. Occasionally, animations will attempt to play like explosions or spellcasting which cause the game to freeze entirely for a second or two. Since I couldn't get a refund with 5 hours of play time, all I can do is hope for patches to alleviate these terrible issues that render the game unplayable.",1
Can't recommend due to poor performance. Stutters like a muthatucker. Will update review on fix.Specs for reference:i9-13900K3090TiRam - 32.0 GB,1
"Horrible performance issues, annoying characters, bad dialogue, weird voice acting and just kind of bloated with a boring story. Mediocre puzzles with the player character telling you what to do every second so you don't get a second to think about the solution, in this regard it almost feels as though you hadn't really accomplished anything. Just play Elden Ring instead..",1
"As a exploration/adventure game, it is probably ok.As a RPG, this game is bellow average. The combat is great, but the talent tree is very limited and offers little to no customization for your character. Also dialog is pretty boring. Almost 20 hours in and I found only 1 dialog option where I felt the awnser changes the outcome little bit. There are no relationship points with the characters based on your actions to determine if they hate you or like you, and the supposed companions are not even showed on minimap if you wanted to talk to them outside of a quest.So if you expected at least a little bit similar game to dragon age or mass effect like I did, save your money, this game is not it.",1

"Firstly, the DLC is not worth it, the game play in your first 10 hours is quite fun, the map of Wizarding world is quite big and have many things to explore. Then you realise that mostly every other contents in the map(outside of the quest you'll encounter) are just some copy and paste, you could say it's same shit just placed else where(even the bug of terrain are being copied LOL). Oh! and the most important thing, you'll find the most annoying character that will force themselves into your game experience(Trust me you won't need to thinking of interact with them, they'll force your hand to do that no matter what because if you don't, guess what? the story then won't proceed LOL. The copied-pasted map content is tolerable for me but this one annoying character almost make me want to quit playing and delete the game.",1

frame rate drop makes game almost unplayable. very unenjoyable. waiting for patch,1
"The game literally will not start for me. I have tried everything. Reinstalled multiple times to different internal and external drives, uninstalled and reinstalled steam, nothing. No problems on any drive running other games, just this one. Another broken AAA launch. Go figure. Don't buy till this is fixed. Nothing from the devs on a fix and it is a known issue. Game has been out for almost a week and the fact that some people can't even play it is far worse than performance issues, though apparently those are rampant too. Received game for free through work program.",1

"clunky, below average role playing game with little depthnot open world, the game won't let you play the game without constant railroading",1
"This game has good gameplay, an interesting open world and an interesting combat system. If you look through the eyes of a simple person who knows nothing about the Harry Potter universe, then there is a possibility that you will not like the game and it will be deleted.Developers failed to do normal optimization. Game crashes, strong frame drops, friezes. And this is on a good PC.",1
"The voice acting is horrible with deep voice characters. Some characters have a way deeper voice, and it is not like Morgan Freeman's voice. It is more like one voice actor and they edited they voice and now the computer makes the electronic sound.Do not select deep voice settings for main character!",1
Underwhelming,1
"This is basically Assassin's Creed but with less freedom to do what you want. I'm 9 hours in or so, and everything has been one big railroad. My only choice so far is the house, and whether I want to hear three voice actor lines or one in conversations. The combat is wonky, it's the same enemies over and over, and they deliberately seem to spawn in a way that you can't see them, and thus making combat ""difficult"" because you can't see any f****** thing. Then there's the weird concept of duels that boils down to having to use leviosa for some reason on yellow shields and accio on blue shields. Oh, and you better like puzzles, because when the game is not frustrating you with bad combat, it's frustrating you with annoying puzzles.The game is beautiful and immersive for sure - but it would have been better as a movie, not as a game.",1
"game with no substance and has a bland ending, felt robbed after seeing the ending with no real difference between good or bad",1
"Game is an unplayable, broken stuttering mess once you get past the first act. Very disappointing that triple A releases continue to get released like this on PC.",1
"This game is fun, but currently, it is UNPLAYABLE. The fps stuttering and drops are insane. While you're around any NPCs, your frames will drop to approx 1.5fps and stay that way until you leave the area. Until they fix this issue, DO NOT BUY",1
Game is fun but  it keeps crashing every few minutes.  There seems to be a memory leak issue with Vram usage. Its almost unplayable in its current state after the patch. Feels really unoptimized.,1
"Unpopular opinion,While the graphics are decent and the wonderful mods from nexus allow for better reshading, I find that the overall combat is comparable to arkham asylum and the player movement to assassins creed mechanics. Not the best of those games mechanics either. For a first time development team I would say this is a really good first attempt, but at the price point for the game and the inability to do much at a challenge, I can not honestly recommend someone to purchase this game at current price.I have played through a Slytherin story line on max difficulty with 28 hours in and I just find the game particularly boring and not challenging enough honestly. I may try another go around for a different story after some more time being released with patches to fix some of the storyline bugs (my ending was glitched with a imelda reyes broom race challenge dialogue for some reason) and with potential DLC, but for $70 the deluxe edition this just wasn't worth it. I'd put this at more of a $30 release game honestly, I've seen much better indie games with a far lower budget than this thing. Can't even play Quidditch lol. All in all I give them a B- the dev team gets an A for their first attempt, but the overall mechanics and lack of immersive detail make this game fall short in a lot of areas. Hopefully DLC will become available to add more features and variety.In short, this is definitely a warner bros. game.",1

"I played this game for a few hours and I would not recommend it due to the poor writing and game crashes. Some things in particular that bugged me:- The game starts and for some reason we are going to Hogwarts as a 5th year, it's not explained what happened to cause this by the time I stopped playing.- It feels like 8/10 people you meet make a similar exclamation ""Oh you're the 5th year new student! Never saw that happen before...""- On our trip to Hogwarts our carriage is attacked by dragons and we watch a man get eaten alive. After we get to Hogwarts everyone is like ""wow you must have have a rough journey"" in a lighthearted tone and very little concern is paid to the dead man or how it may have affected my character who just saw it happen like a day ago.(Our character seems rather unbothered by it.)- The writing around the 1st trip to Hogsmeade was especially bad. One example, as the bad guy is leaving the bar after threatening us for a few minutes (causing a commotion the whole bar notices) he says something like  ""You can't stay in here forever"" and steps outside with his cronies. The next scene me and my classmate are walking out of the bar by ourselves with no regard for concern of this guy who just threatened us and who made the implication he would be waiting outside. He was not outside an we made it back to Hogwarts no problem. After we step outside we decide to fast travel back to Hogwarts.....- The game crashed a few times in 3 hours of playing. The game is very pretty and I might buy heavily discounted. The writing was mostly awful though so maybe not.",1
Really good PowerPoint game,1
not worth at all :),1

"This game has a lot going for it, good sound design, great music, gorgeous graphics. But the game is rather hollow Characters are  really bad, like they aren't even generic they have as much personality as a text to speech voice. The quest are boring and most of the games play time is through filler collectibles to add fluff to their hollow game.tldr your alone for most of the game running for bookpages, this is 90% of the game play",1
"1. Game runs like shit, my computer is not the best, but it meets all the recommended requirements.2. I'm running it on mostly medium-high with V2 AMD Performance Upscaling.. And the experience is actually fucking awful.3. I'm still getting major stutters constantly and 100% freeze frames in combat which have killed me a lot.4. Learn to fucking benchmark correctly, you stupid fucks - only reason I got as far as I have is because I grew up with these stupid movies.",1
"Now, let me preface this by saying I do love what I've played thus far and maybe you will too.The world is amazing, the castle is amazing, the game play is amazing, it's all wonderfulBUTIt runs terribly on PC, it varies but all in all the PC port needs better optimization and even worse the current update and drivers for AMD have completely stopped me from being able to load up the game.  I can't even get past the initial disclaimer.  So as of right now, I can't recommend it in spite of the good time I've had.",1
"[h1]Hogwarts Legacy: ""The game excels in bringing the world of Harry Potter to life, but falls short with underdeveloped characters and a lack of impactful narrative choices."" [/h1]Hogwarts Legacy has been widely praised by fans of the Harry Potter universe, but in my opinion, the game falls short of the hype. While it's a decent game overall with a 7/10 rating from me, I can't help but feel that it's lacking in many areas. As someone who enjoys immersive experiences and deep storytelling, I found several aspects of the game disappointing.[h2]Section 1[/h2][b]No Karma System:[/b] It's disappointing that a game that aims to immerse players in the Harry Potter universe doesn't penalize players for using banned or prohibited spells. There's also a lack of meaningful consequences for the choices players make, which takes away from the potential depth and impact of the game's narrative.[h2]Section 2[/h2][b]Predictable and Flat Storytelling: [/b]The game's characters lack personality, and the protagonist is essentially perfect in everything they do. The constant praise and lack of any real consequences for failures or mistakes make the experience feel generic and dull. With so much potential for interesting character development and branching narratives, the game fails to deliver on its promise.[h2]Section 3[/h2][b]Poor Optimization: [/b]The game is not optimized well. Even with an RTX 3060 graphics card and 12 GB of RAM, performance issues can make the game almost unplayable. This is a problem for players with better hardware as well, and it's frustrating to see such poor optimization in a game with so much potential.[h2]Section 4[/h2][b]Repetitive Combat and Missions:[/b] While the game's combat system starts out dynamic, it quickly becomes monotonous. The introduction of new spells feels more like upgrades than genuinely new and exciting abilities. The numerous side missions are also repetitive, following a predictable formula that quickly becomes tedious.[h1]Conclusion[/h1]Overall, Hogwarts Legacy falls short of the magic of the Harry Potter universe. While the initial experience can be enjoyable, the lack of innovation, depth, and consequences make the game feel generic and uninspired. It's disappointing that the game fails to deliver on its potential for an immersive and engaging experience. While diehard Harry Potter fans may still find some enjoyment in the game, those looking for a fresh and unique gaming experience will likely be disappointed.",1

Where serious story line, competitions between faculties, where drama and blood. You can't even punch npc. One more about ""Unforgivable Curses"", where or for who they are unforgivable? I think this game a big disappointment for old fans. Yes, game have great music and other a few things but overall it's not worth it.If this game for kids.

"Playing on hard. This game starts out amazing. Its like watching a movie, but the combat is challenging, dynamic, fast paced, and addicting in a way that old hack and slash games used to be. Here's where it gets lame: The challenge burns out FAST. By level 19 I stopped picking up gear and looting chests because it was simply not needed in order to keep killing enemies. I stopped leveling things and unlocking spells because there was no need for my character to get stronger. Just to give it a foolproof test, I ran to the edge of the map. All of the edges. Which did not take me long, which was even more depressing. In all the land, I could not find a foe that I could not best, even in ""end game content"" areas, so to speak. This made the game hollow. Then I realized: there are only FOUR types of enemies. You read that right, 4. Bipedal humans (or other wizards and witches), giant frogs, giant spiders, trolls. After you learn their moves, you just breeze through any part of the map. Oh yeah and goblins. so 5. Anyway: 1.) Too easy2.) Small World Map3.) Needs more enemies 4.) Game too shortConcept is fantastic, whereas elden ring was a ""souls"" type game based off a popular book and movie franchise, hogwarts legacy is a ""scrolls"" type game based off a popular book and movie franchise. But they should have taken the PVE enemies more serious. That specific dynamic is the foundation of what keeps you advancing your character, ie: playing the game. And maybe I'm wrong about all this, but I shouldn't be able to sprint anywhere on the map and survive willy-nilly, when I just started the game a few days ago, so, there's my final point.",1

"Performance is absolutely abysmal for this game, sadly. After putting in 60 hours, the only times the game manages to run smoothly is in very specific rooms when using the Frame Generation option from 4000 series cards, and even then you see massive dips, alongside the constant stuttering.

Game isnt terrible. Love the setting and the amazing work they Dev's did to really bring Hogwarts to life (the actual school).....that said once the novelty of this being in the Hogwarts universe wears off it just feels like every other open world game out there......Its Far Cry / Assassins Creed but with wands. I think there will be a lot of people that will get 20-30 hours into this and just find themselves not wanting to play anymore. Spoiler!!:My biggest issue with this game is the whole poaching thing........ SO magical beasts are being poached and that is bad.....I totally agree. SO what does your character do to save them? He shoves them in a bag and takes them to a magical pasture (which can only hold 12 beasts (24 when you get the 2nd magical pasture). What do you do with the rest? You sell them at a pet shop for money...............which is poaching...........Oh and you can breed them too! soo you can sell off the babies to the pet shop.........for money.......your basically just a magical puppy mill...........wtf....,1
"The game has good atmosphere and fun combat but it's held back by a lot of things.Performance/stuttering/bad frametimes regardless of settingsSlow pacingA lot of handholdingUbisoft checklist of collectibles even leveling/experience is connected to thisUninteresting side characters/boring dialogueYou don't have a quest log, have to single out each quest one by oneChoices don't matterGet on sale",1
"Until the performance issues are addressed and fixed, I won't be recommending Hogwart's Legacy. I'll update this review once they are.",1
"while the game play was good and it made me feel like i was closer to being in the movies  with how good the story was and the combat system was great im sadly giving a bad review because of a simple reason, the game is far to short  im lv 32 ive done most the side quests and relationship quests completed over half the wizard guide as well got 87% of collectibles and mainstory is beat,  all in whats actually 31 hours idk why it says 33 my save file says 31 anyways the game is far to short i paid 70 dollars for 30ish hours of gameplay guess i will go back to one of my older games that keep me interested and have more content   :( if you like short and quick/easy games this is the game for you!",1
I think you've got to be a Harry Potter fan to enjoy this game. It's pretty painfully boring in the opening hours of the game.  The little bit of actual combat I got to play was also pretty underwhelming.  I've got another hour left on my refund window so I will likely be returning this.  I'm sure there's a decent game here but I can't tolerate much boredom in video games.,1
"The game is exciting and I really wanted to keep playing but going from indoor to outdoor areas kept dropping FPS. Also, I could barely reach stable 60 FPS - even at low. This is with a 1080 Ti, which handles most modern games at around 80-120.They need to fix this. It's poorly optimized.",1
"I wish I could leave a mixed rating. It's just not the RPG I wanted to play but it does have some great moments.I honestly really enjoy the main questline, the first couple of hours in the castle are incredible, but a lot of the side quests are really shallow. I had to focus on the gobstones quest just so my wizard would shut up about it when running through Hogwarts. But will I ever see this character and her Gobstones again, maybe in a different quest? Probably not. It's kind of a watered down RPG.But more notably:- I think a lot of early open world encounters feel out of context or too ""gamified"", one of the worst offenders being why does breaking 10 random pots scattered around this statue turn it into a portal for a dark magic battle arena? Why do I suddenly know how to cast all these unforgivable curse spells?- A system enticing to completionists is your only way to get upgrades like inventory space. Kind of sucks if you don't like repetitive points of interest objectives.- You can buy very few items with gold so prices seem very expensive from the start. Not being able to progress a main quest because I don't have enough gold to buy some plant seeds is frustrating. It gets even worse when you realise you can't grow the seeds you just bought with literally all your gold because somehow you are only allowed a small pot in the greenery and you need a large pot. The large pot from what I understand can only be used when you buy the entire large pot table, for your room of requirement. Which I did not have at this point in the game. Which of course costs 5 times the amount of gold the seeds were worth. I still wonder why I didn't put the game down at this point.- Navigating the Hogwarts world map is one of the hardest puzzles in the game.- Why can't I sleep in my Hogwarts bed to progress time, why can I only use a menu button on the map to do this? - Why are there only guards in the castle when I'm doing a quest? Why is the castle completely empty during night? But hey them enchanted violins are still going strong. - No consequences for any quests or actions? No choices at all in fact.- My wizard giving puzzle hints during some quests, just let me handle it okay? I wish more games had an option to turn off puzzle help.I love the early game because the quests can be really great, something I want to play an RPG for. But once you start having to ""be a good student"" and complete more and more single objective side quests and having to complete the mostly uninspired encounters in the open world these little frustrations add up to a mixed rating. Who is this game made for?I'm just sad that quite a few of potential RPG elements are left up to the player's imagination for the sake of a simpler game. Short side-quests, short encounters, little puzzles, etc. The only thing with depth feels like the main quest and the castle exploration and I think I'm putting the game down as soon as I finish it.I would recommend if you're a Harry Potter fan but if you like RPGs honestly you better lower your expectations when you try it out.",1
honestly the game is pretty damn mid and boring if im gonna be honest. It was amazing for like the first 4 hours then the game became a boring ass copy and paste shitty rpg. If you wanna play the game just hold off for summer steam sale.,1
"1840, England and there are literally black people everywhere ??+ the game runs like dog shit",1
"I will recommend this great game when Avalanche decides to update and fix the Everest mountain of performance issues, such as but not limited to, memory leaks, poor optimization, old DLSS implementation, etc.I didn't pay 70+ CH to play a PowerPoint slideshow.",1
"Lots of dialogue and not very interesting plot. Side quests are boring.Terrible management!The character is not in the center, but on the left, and shoots somewhere to the right. Why can't you change the camera? For me, the character is very close, I want to move it away and improve the view. When porting from consoles, we didn't think much about PC players.There are a lot of spells and skills, why weren't such spells like lumos taken out separately? Or they could make a couple more panels of spell sets.The music in the game is unremarkable.",1
"ehh after completing the main story of the game all i can say is ehh. wanted to be a ""dark wizard"" in the game and hope my so called choices would make m,y character evil and my character ended up more like hermione granger in the end. If your looking to be a dark wizard in this game all i can say is move along. Gmod harry potter Rp is better than this IMO.",1
"The graphics settings are broken. regardless of whether I run on ultra or low, the world is low poly and nothing will change it. I used to be able to fix this by running things on low with ultra textures, but that no longer works either. I'. livid and will be getting a refund. so disappointing.I'm sure the game is great for a lot of people but this is actually making it unplayable for me and its not fair to expect me to pay $60 for a game that does this shit.",1
I would recommend waiting until stuttering and other performance issues are fixed before getting the game. Is fun but ruined by stuttering for me,1
"The plot is dull and extremely outdated.In every chance it gets, the game drops some bul****t about dangerous powers only being problematic when wielded by bad people.The team could have done a better job if they only observed the reality in 2023.",1
"performance is so bad it shut off my pc completely multiple times, wait for a patch before you buy(rtx 2070 + r5 3600, 32gb ram)",1
"I pretty like the game, but the backseat from our character is horrendous. Please things like that should be optional...Optimization is pretty bad too.",1
"I can't give this a positive review until all the massive performance issues are solved. I have a decent rig capable of comfortably running the more extensive recent releases on good graphics but this game just doesn't run, nevermind well. I'm constantly stuck at under 40 frames with spikes that go as low as 1FPS with all of this being on the lowest graphical settings possible. The stuttering is horrendous paired with the overall lag that just happens while running around and visiting areas, it's just too much to bare and is generally unplayable.Can't recommend this until all of this is fixed. I would love to as the game does seem interesting and fun but just no.",1
"The game is dull, I have no idea how they managed to turn Hogwarts into a series of collectibles but they sure did it.Positives? Combat and decent visuals.Negatives? Everything else, there is no interesting content in the game, everything is too simple and easy, Harry Potter Ubisoft edition.",1
"Too many technical issues like shadows or lights popping out of nowhere, missing textures and meshes, after playing for a while; constant stutters in locations when you open the doors, and all that on fairly decent PC. All this is not being patched, and only modders already fixing this s**t with Unreal Engine console commands and tweaks. So, the last sentence at least means that most issues are not due to hardware or video driver failures, it's all only developers laziness to deliver a proper product from the start.",1
"Hogwarts Legacy is a great game, but if you are considering whether to purchase it, the right answer is NOT NOW. The game currently has optimization problems (frame drops with even 3070, on mid setting), and commands a full price-tag but obviously have many DLCs planned.It is better to wait until when the optimization problems are fixed, and when it goes on sale ---- perhaps along with a few future DLCs for a better optimized experience.",1
If you're after good gameplay just play Elden Ring instead.,1
Very bad optimization for pc,1
"I tried to like this game, i really did, streamed my experience, will continue off and on to do so. Game is very dialogue heavy, to the point to where i want to smack my head against my coffee table over and over again. Game looks amazing, have the settings maxed out with a 3090ti, game is wonderfully optimized, especially for it just being released. Music amazing, mechanics, spell casting all amazing!! Where this game falls short for me is, the amount of dialogue i have to go through just to actually fight and progress through the game is....lol, it literally drives me nuts. I'm 8 hrs in and still feel like im in a tutorial with about 45 seconds of fighting, which is amazing and feels like a breath of fresh air, then you go back to hours of more dialogue that makes you want to pull your hair out and or break everything around you, including your PC. I understand what the hype is about this game i suppose?? However @ the same time, i do not, it does not hold my attention and it feels like a chore to play through.",1
"A very pretty look at the world of Harry Potter but everything else is extremely shallow. The quests and stories are mostly unsatisfying.There's never any real choice in what you do.Your character's actions are wildly inconsistent.The world feels nonreactive and dead.They sold this as a immersive world and build your legacy (vague as it is), but in reality it's a non immersive theme park ride where nothing you do really matters.If you're a fan of the HP franchise then you should enjoy seeing the well crafted locations for yourself, for everyone else don't bother unless it's on a sale.",1
The game is brilliant but the performance is dog-poop if you dare to enable Ray Tracing...,1
"Amazing game with one of the worst optimization. Even after updating all drivers and few patches and mods it goes from 70 fps to 5 fps while STANDING IN PLACE. I want to give it thumb up, but at this stage - nuh uh. AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, 32gb RAM, RTX 3070ti 8GB, so not too shabby.",1
There are games that look and run better than this game. There needs to be an optimization update ASAP because requiring more than 18+GB of VRAM is INSANE. I will change my review once there's an update to fix this issue.,1
"The game is unplayable, won't even load, after the patch. Total waste of money. Before the patch it worked fine and seemed like a good game. After the patch, won't even load.",1
"a buggy, un-optimized port that has little faith in its own ability to run on high end machines.While the artstyle and representation is highly accurate to the illistrated editions of Jim Kay's artwork, unfortunately, because of J.K. Rowling's views, I would not reccomend purchasing the game.On top of multiple bugs found within the first 15 minutes, J.K. Rowling, whom debatedly had a very small part in the development of this gamer, still makes major royalties with every purchase, which further funds her ideology and bigotry towards Transgender Individuals.I am only playing the game due to having been gifted a copy from my coworkers.",1
game so poorly optimized u could say its like magic,1
"The game is great, but leaving a negative review until the atrocious performance issues are resolved. I am well above the recommended hardware (3700x/rtx2080/32GB ram) and even if I set the graphic settings bellow the recommended ones, the game still stutters like crazy on various areas in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. I haven't played any other game that stutters this much. Even Forspoken was running better in my system",1
"honestly it just wasnt that good, a very mid story with little to no player choice. if its gonna have such little player choice it will need a good story which it doesnt deliver on. Dont get me wrong the combat is amazing and fun but the story is just mid",1
"The game is sufficient in the things that it tries to do. The problem is: these things are absimally boring. The things missing are school life mechanics ( like persona) interesting characters, a little more interesting puzzles, elemental interaction with the world  and engaging writing. Unfortunately this game is a shallow husk",1
"Game runs poorly, i have a 32g computer with lots of memory and game still lags and crashes, tried to get a refund from steam but they tell me no there is nothing wrong with the game that they can see, so unless you have an expensive computer, do not get this game on steam or with out a high end computer, see YouTube for this as many are saying what i am, get on PS5 or Xbox just don't get on computer",1
"Terrible performance on PC. My RTX 3080 can't handle it. It freezes, lags, has low frame rates and stuttering issues, it even crashed a couple of times.The game itself is amazing, world is beautiful but can't be enjoyed as is due to poor optimization. No amount of suggested ""fixes"" out there help, this latest patch didnt help, in fact todays lag was much worse than yesterday when I first started (prior to the patch). Can't thumbs up until its fixed.",1
"Is it fun? Maybe, but hear me out.The world map section is janky af and not function well.Side quest is very bland, like what's the point of it?Performance side Oh boy, I'm sorry if I have a lowly peasant rig, but man, am I playing PowerPoint Legacy right now?I got an R5 2600x RTX 2070 with 16GB of RAM, and oh boy, 40-50 fps in most areas with ""optimal settings"" and shuttering?very frequency. Overall, I didn't say it was a bad game; it's just not a 9.5/10 thing. Imagine a better Ubisoft game with Harry Potter skins. that what it is.P.S. And please don't hate on me, ""Hogwarts stan""",1
"0/10 no pigfartsFor real though, the game just isn't for me. The combat is boring and basically just becomes a spam fest with every enemy having basically 1 attack that is mostly similar to all the rest of the enemies 1 attack and they all have way too much health. The world is cool at first but very quickly becomes repetitive and the actual layout of the land doesn't instill much wonder. The story is fine, certainly nothing to write home about. No justification for why the bad guy is bad or why it is this high schoolers problem to deal with. No justification for the ministry not stepping in except ""they won't listen"" or ""maybe he's paying them off"" or some generic nonsense. For me the worst part was the relationships which basically don't exist. The game never adequately introduces a single character or really makes you give a damn about any of them, including your own character. With games like FFXIV for story and Elden Ring for world building and exploration it's really hard to enjoy these games anymore.Never been much of a Harry Potter fan though so I think if you have more of an attachment to this world you would probably like this game. I would give a ""meh"" if I could as I could see people more familiar with the world then me getting far more enjoyment out of this game.",1
"Hogwarts is a okay game in general (of course you can't take a game like red dead 2 to benchmark it) but there are many places that need improvement, for example: wild beasts not only need to change their skins, clothing uniform style different colors count as different clothes, and the model problems. Not only that, many reward mechanisms are also very unreasonable, for example, the reward for cave exploration is not exciting, followed by the exploration time is also short, and not much content inside of it. Four skills/ spells are not enough to use or easy to press the wrong key (feeding a spider? can you imagine that? lol).At the same time, the story plot is moderate, is the hero to save the world, but the multi-character plot can not be skipped or the plot itself is not attractive enough problem, so that players get the spell is not clear after the plot and immersion destruction.This game can be developed online lobby, remove all standing-dolls like NPCs, add a full range of magical animals, the player is divided into two camps Auror and the black wizard, develop a season, etc etc",1
"Optimization is not great. There's just random stutters, choppiness and whatnot that were rumored to be getting fixed in a day one patch that never materialized. After the most recent patch (February 14th, 2023), the issues still remain.Unless enemies are going to throw more AOE attacks at me, I see absolutely not reason to shield and(/or) counter when I can just dodge roll out of the way and just keep slinging spells.The menus are far overly animated; I want to be able to just get in, do what I need to do and get out. Also, why can't I just straight quit out of a submenu back into the game? That's just shitty UI design.The map blows chunks. Should have just kept it flat with layers instead of using this 3D bullshit that makes it nearly impossible to tell which fast travel waypoint is closest to the object you're trying to get to.Combat could be interesting... but it mostly devolves into dodge rolling and shooting for me because I don't want have to pay attention to cooldowns; yeah, I might have to use pull or float to break a shield, but it kind of plays like if Dark Souls was a crappy shooter, because while I'd rather just pull and flamethrower, once I use flamerthrower, pull and flamethrower both get put on cooldown. It's just not that engaging to me; one of the early boss fights, I dodgerolled and LMBed my way to victory without once using any spells.Invisible walls everywhere. If you're going to give me the option to jump, climb and hurdle, I want to be able to hurdle the separator between those 180 degree turn staircases instead of having to go all the way around, especially if you show my character being able to jump high enough to clear the barrier.That reverse curling minigame sucks.The story feels really up its own backside. Like the devs are really enamored with a story that just seems like it's telegraphing a bunch of stuff. Plus, I'm not sure that many players care about the story (anecdotally, the two people in meatspace I've talked to haven't cared about it just want to explore the world and go kill things, respectively), and it spends way too much time cutsceneing.Also, why is it a fade to black to pet a cat?I don't particularly like my character. He's way too trusting, too smiley, and kind of a idiot, though I wonder how much of that has to do with house (I'm in Hufflepuff, even though the Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin); it would be interesting if they wrote the character differently if they were put in different houses, and if the hat wanted to put the in one house and they wanted to go in another, but I think that'd be too much work for too little payoff.The stealth is very basic, but I guess that's understandable because it feels like one of those things that were added to the game because the original series had a cloak of invisibility, so they felt obligated to do something with it. It's not done all that interesting, and there's not much you can do with it besides essentially go invisible and stay out of the enemies' cone of vision.It could be fun if the choppiness didn't frequently give me motion sickness, and if I had more choices for friends than the obligatory one from every house. There's a couple characters who I've met, who are probably sidequest characters, who I think I'd have been more interested in being friends with than the four main characters the devs designed as companions. Now that one witch who got in trouble because she wanted to invent her own charms but then did it in the library? She could be an extra nerdy, kind of oblivious version of Hermione that I could get behind.Morning of the first day of classes, after just waking up, two girls walked into my dorm room (I'm playing as a dude this run) and sat down... Like, that's a thing that should have been caught in QA, just two random girls intruding on a dorm room for four boys.I mean, it can be fun, but it feels a lot like an Ubi open-world game given Dark Souls-esque combat, except shooter instead of hack & slash, with a coat of Harry Potter paint. It feels less RPG and more JRPG. Some of the dialog options are kind of weird: one sidequest had me retrieve a bunch of balls that spray a foul liquid on the loser of the game they're used to play because the people had taken the balls from the person and hid them; after I brought the balls back to the person who they belonged to, they told me they were going to try to play the game some more, and I had the option to tell them that might be a bad idea, so I did; I expected to tell them it was a bad idea because they'd probably have their balls hidden again, but instead, I told them it was a bad idea because nobody wanted to sprayed by the liquid, which seems really dumb because a person agreeing to play the game would already know there's a risk in getting sprayed, seeing how that's part of the rules of the game. It's just shit writing.The world feels magical, kind of, but the gameplay does not.",1
"This game runs pretty bad, plus the story isn't as engaging as I wanted it to be but the part where the dragons attack is funny.",1
"Game still doesn't start past the seizure warning, even when there is a new patch. Paid a game and can't play it",1
"[b]The minimum requirements they've listed for this game are wrong.[/b] If you're playing on a medium-tier computer, I cannot in good conscience recommend buying this game. No matter what kind of settings I applied, my GTX 1070 Ti and i5 6600K 3.5GHz struggled to give out smooth performance to the point where I was forced to stop playing until I can get a new computer.Horrible freezes and stutters when running around, jumping, or doing pretty much anything. Combat was especially bad and I had to lower the difficulty to Easy because my game would stutter and freeze mid-combat for several seconds, causing me to die.Gameplay and story seemed fun though, but if performance is a concern for you (as it was for me), I cannot recommend buying this yet. I'll update this review when I get a computer that can run the game.",1
"Four hours in, and it's just standard tutorial cut sequences.  You can skip them readily enough, and the music and animation is nice, but the only battle sequences have felt contrived and uninteresting, and it's taken me 4 days to play 4 hours... when I first dug into Ark: survival, I played over 40 hours in 4 days, same with the various GTAs, and most any other fun game.. but it's just been really hard to find this game interesting enough to keep at it.  So far, this game looks like it's aimed exclsively at the fan base.. there's lots of interactive bobbles that animate and shoot fireworks or tell a joke or whatever.. it can create quite a feeling of nastalgia for the movies I'm sure, but as it ends up just being a bunch of pointless activities, it doesn't hold much interest to me looking to engage in actual gameplay.    Maybe this game gets great down the road.. I'll keep plugging away at it to try to reveal that worthwhile content.. bus as of 4 hrs in, they were the longest in-game 4 hours I can remember in quite some time.",1
Fortnite is better,1
zajebal,1
"All drama aside, its very mediocre. The combat/game play loop is initially kinda fun, but it essentially doesn't change beyond the player acquiring  new spells. New enemy types are sorely needed. You just want to skip through it by the end of the gameThe best content are the relationship quests and the main quest line, but even this content is hampered by the relatively poor writing. There is essentially only one interesting side character (Sebastian). The quests involving him inform the player about the world and there's even a bit of player agency involved.If you only know about Harry Potter through cultural osmosis like myself, a lot of the basic rules and customs  are never adequately explained. I would have loved to know more about the Goblin/Elf status in the world and the dark arts. unfortunately we only get about 1 or two conversations about these things, even through they are key part of the plot.A lot of the development time was clearly spent on the room of requirement stuff. I really thought all of that was a waste of time, but it may have a lot of appeal to people who like building things.Overall its pretty meh.",1
"After 9 hours I feel: Frustrated, confused, bored, pandered too, coddled, gouged, angry and disappointed :(Wish I could get a refund but duh...I stand corrected they issued my refund so yay!",1
Great game but awful performance optimization Constant stuttering and fps drops,1
New update 2/14  can't open the game now?,1
crashes every 5 mins.,1
"I pre-ordered the deluxe edition in order to play the game 3 days early. It ran just barely well enough to get through the tutorial, but as soon as I got to Hogwarts I started getting stuttering issues every 20-30 seconds no matter what I was doing. I made it to Hogsmeade and somehow the stuttering issues/frame drops got even worse. I have multiple clips where my game completely freezes for 10+ seconds before returning to 15 frames per second. My last 5 hours of play time have been SOLELY DEVOTED TO TRYING TO FIX THE STUTTERING. I have attempted every single fix that has been shared online, downloaded a mod that has fixed the issue for some people, changed .ini settings in some data files, nothing has worked. I should NOT be expected to fix a game myself. I have downloaded the patches that have come out for the game and none of them have improved my situation. I PRE-ORDERED THE GAME SO THAT I COULD PLAY IT EARLY, NOT TRY TO FIX PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS. I legitimately only got 2-3 hours of ACTUAL game time before the stuttering got so bad that it is literally unplayable. Every single time I cast a spell the game freezes for 3 seconds. Kind of hard to play a game about using spells when EVERY TIME I USE A SPELL MY GAME FREEZES. I can't believe this game was allowed to be sold in it's current state, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT OFFERS EARLY GAMEPLAY FOR PRE-ORDERS. Review will not change until game is fixed.",1
"It's a fun game but it's definitely not what I thought it to be. Classes mean very little and although you're at Hogwarts it feels more like a backdrop to only skill up just to take down the bad guys. This is more so aimed at combat gamers. If you're going in thinking you're going to make friends and attend/live at Hogwarts as a student, this is your warning now. Go in prepared to fight because that's what you're going to be doing most of the time. Trust me you'll enjoy yourself way more.I'm choosing not to recommend only on the bases that I know many HP fans were thinking they would be playing as a student and the truth is you're not. However please do check it out if only to walk around, its freaking beautiful.",1

It's a good game but I just lost almost 90hrs of progress because the river treasure vault next to Keenbridge is broken. my caricature is stuck in there unable to move or access the map to fast travel out. If you do buy this game i suggest not going into that vault. (you'll only be missing out on a average gear item).,1
"Very Poorly OptimizedI'll change my review when/if an optimization patch comesThe game defaults to 60FPS which runs fine but that drastically changes if you go higher.With an AMD Radeon 6900XT at 160Hz High settings, the game was utilizing 100% of my GPU and 8GB of VRAMLowering the settings to Low and 144Hz, and it was still using 88% of my high-end card",1
The save file in this game have broken on me twice now. I'm tired of games releasing in broken states like this. This is completely unacceptable. This paired with performance issues and other various bugs completely ruin an otherwise fantastic game. Do not buy this game until they've sorted these issues out.,1
"Game releases, pc performance is terrible, reported to use 40+ gigs of memory and only half GPU power. Try user found fixes, works better but not perfect. I have a 3070ti Ultra and I was getting a whole NINE fps during the Sorting Ceremony at the beginning. What the actual fuck, WB? Just pausing, touching nothing, and unpausing would cause performance to tank for no reason. Obvious memory leaks galore.February 14, a patch is released to fix performance and other issues. It is also rumored to delete your save games, erasing all your progress.

boring,1
"Sadly they dont seem to treat PC gamers seriously...Comparing what we are experiencing here with what's on PS5...Not so happy now after the patch.I would recommend this game, just not on PC.",1
"Wait for this to go on sale, not a bad game but certainly nothing to write home about. You get very mild ""good v bad"" options when talking to people sometimes but in the end it doesn't matter what you said or even if you ran around using unforgivable spells. Everyone gets the same, lame, cookie cutter ending. Early in mid-game loot becomes almost unimportant. Eventually you'll unlock a bit of upgrading for what you are wearing but at no point will you ever make something unique. Also, many of the ""collectible chests"" literally have... Nothing, not even a few pieces of gold for your trouble. It's just there to hold the place for achievements. I also did not like that our character would only wait 2 seconds before instantly blurting out the answer to your current predicament. ""WoW iF oNlY wE hAd SoMe LiGhT"" I get it, you want players to have hints and not get frustrated during main story, but give me a minute to make mistakes and smack my face into the wall a few times until I want a hint rather than instantly bluntly telling me the answer.",1
Poor performance,1
"Hogwarts Legacy is one of the strangest games i've ever played. To start, the positives. The castle is AMAZING, it's beautiful and feels exactly like they portrayed the castle in the movies. The map is huge, there is an insane amount of things to do, and a significant amount of side quests to conquer. Learning the spells is super cool, exploring the castle is super cool, and the amount of callbacks to things from the movies are great (for example devils snare from the first movie makes an appearance, and a scene in the opening of the game is awesome). But for all the great things about the game, there are tons of confusing additions that just feel like they were added only to bloat the runtime and give more pointless things to do.For example, there are TONS of locked doors around the castle, Hogsmeade, and around the open world. EVERY SINGLE ONE involves a lockpicking minigame. On its own, the minigame isn't bad but the amount of times you go through rotating the two circles to unlock a door to get some small collectible, piece of gear, or small amount of gold is way too high. On one street of hogsmeade there are 5 separate locked doors that you have the ability to open. On top of having way too many locks, you have to go through the whole map and find these small collectibles to unlock higher levels of lockpicking. There are three levels of lockpicking, and you don't unlock your first level until about the mid-late stage of the game.But there are even more systems within the game, you have player housing, pokemon catching animals to harvest materials for clothing upgrades, talents, a korok trial (from breath of the wild) esque system to expand your inventory, an ""ancient magic"" collectible to upgrade your ancient magic bar to higher capacities, a star gazing minigame, floating pages around the world to unlock transmog, gear upgrade levels and traits (which add a bonus to offense/defense against certain enemies or while using certain spells), enemy base camps, broom riding poppable balloons, broom riding races, broom upgrades, plant growth and harvesting, potion brewing,dungeon delving, and three other systems/things to do that I haven¡¯t unlocked yet at 21 hours of playtime.Now obviously, it is NOT a bad thing to have alot of things to do in a game. But the amount in the game is overwhelming. At any moment you have 20 things you could be doing, and the game never really gives you a break to explore things. Most main quests to farther areas ends up back at Hogwarts, with you ready to do another main quest which starts in Hogwarts. With all the extra systems and things to do in the game, animations are still stiff and weird, and with the an INSANE amount of cutscenes its very noticeable. There are tons of small animation details added in some areas, but then other areas are neglected. For example, all NPCs that ride brooms do a static animation, where they hold the broom and just kinda fly around without moving.The things other people have said about enemy variety is true, there is a very limited amount. There are 8 enemy types, those being wizards, goblins, trolls, spiders, wolves, dugbogs (frog lizard things),inferi (fancy zombies), and stone soldiers. But I don¡¯t really mind the limited amount of enemy types, I'm 21 hours in and I haven't really gotten tired of fighting anything. The combat is not fun though. You have a base magic attack and a bunch of fancy spells which can be fun to use. I just don¡¯t like the combat. It's boring for me to spam click my base magic attack and break shields with specific spells. I¡¯m sure i could play more in depth, but just using the fancy spells doesn¡¯t do alot of damage. I spent about 45 seconds beating one wizard up using only my fancy spells. In my opinion, that¡¯s a long time to kill one enemy when the spells you¡¯re using have cooldowns because they¡¯re meant to be strong. (the 45 seconds is not counting any cooldown time, I had about 11 fancy spells at this point and was able to always have at least one to use).There are three mounts in the game, a hippogryph, one I haven't unlocked yet, and the broom. Of the two that I've unlocked so far, they¡¯re both cool but lacking in some areas. For example, you can¡¯t look up or down while on the broom, only side to side. And the hippogryph feels really gross to move, kinda like you¡¯re driving a car in the air.All in all, honestly the game just isn¡¯t for me. I personally wouldn¡¯t recommend it, but it's really going to be up to you if you want to get the game or not. It feels like someone saw the best things from the last 10 years of games and took aspects from everything. The dialogue with characters is similar to the witcher 3, the gear system is like the modern assassin¡¯s creed games, etc.If you like games where you have an overwhelming amount of options for things to do, I'd say you should look more into getting Hogwarts Legacy. If you like games where everything is super polished with meaningful things to do, I'd say you probably look elsewhere for something to play. But thats just my opinion.Im about 67% of the way through the main game by now, but my opinion changes by the end of the game i¡¯ll update the review.",1
"This is every Harry Potter fans dream, being able to place your self into the world and explore. Uploading your own House and Wand from Pottermore. Game has really good story telling, great graphics, and has plenty amount of content to enjoy. Lots of collectibles for you to find and puzzles galore. This game is nostalgia lane for Harry Potter fans. Unfortunately, the game is really screaming for MORE. Yes, the game has a lot of content, but it just feels... Unfinished. Its a great Harry Potter Sandbox with plenty to do, but could use more ways of immersing yourself into the game. Your character just feels... invisible to the whole world.There are unfortunately a few things that could use some improvement.1.) Robotic Voices if you choose anything higher or lower pitch. I had to restart my game due to how badly processed it was when I selected a lower pitch voice for my character.2.) You can slap students in the face, yet, they barely react. Only once have I heard anybody say anything to me slashing my wand all over the place. Random NPCs feel empty. They do interactions, spells, and talk to each other, but yet you feel invisible to the whole world.3.) The amount of times I hear about Flu Powder or how Hogsmeade has all of the roads that end there. Could they have worked more on adding more voice lines?..4.) Students don't react to what I wear, I just feel out of place. Especially at night time, where are the teachers looking out? Why doesn't anybody tell me to go to bed?5.) Performance issues with a LOT of people. I can max out 4K with my 10900k, RTX 3090, 32gb DDR4-4000 Ram, but it consistently stutters.6.) No Quidditch, they flat out knocked it out right at the beginning of entering Hogwarts. I don't understand why this wasn't put into the game. Feels like a portion of the world is missing.7.) Not enough gender neutral long hair. Seems like all of the hair is meant for females.8.) Only able to have 4 spells at a time. Have fun switching consistently.Now, I might say that I don't recommend this game, but I actually do. If I could stay Neutral in the middle I would. I just wish there was MORE to the game. Fetch quest here, go there, return. Just feels like a huge open world Harry Potter world with simple collectibles, puzzles, and quests. Your character feels invisible to the world which in my opinion ruins the immersion.Do yourself a favor and do some research before buying and trying out the game. Is it worth it? Yes. Could you possibly feel disappointed after playing the game? Absolutely. If I could rate this on Steam, I'd give it 3/5.",1
Stutters on a 13700K / 4090 / 32GB DDR5,1
game has a known save file issue make sure to keep a constant back up. game still bugs out when you load old saves.,1
"Is this a good game? Maybe, but it's hard to tell when this game keeps dropping frames and stuttering. The framerate issue is especially horrible in outdoors section. Devs promised a day-one patch that would address the issues, but four days later and the game is still as broken as the pre-release version. Do not be swayed by the positive reviews, this is a terrible port, and the devs don't seem to care too much about fixing it.",1
it crashes and crashes and crashes and crashes.  Every time it makes you sit there while it is slooooooowly preparing the shaders then crashes........,1
new patch made this unplayable. was a good game though,1
"Enjoyed the game when I could play it but after the game launches the first time, any future attempt to launch the game causes my CPU to go to 100 when I've updated drivers, have plenty of open storage, and no other apps open. Additionally it causes a black screen after the seizure warning prompt and doesn't work after. Hopefully this issue gets addressed soon because when I could play the game it was pretty fun.",1
Game has been amazing so far until I got to the poly juice potion quest and had leave. Now my game will not load from any saved file.,1
4/10 - play it if you love the potter series - personally never read/seen any besides the first movie (which was trash lmao) - its just a dialogue simulator in the potter universe. 10-20 min cut-scenes/dialogue transitions into 15 minutes of flying/running around into more dialogue and then 30 second fights and repeat - on top of bad optimization. Sad.,1
"Huge missed opportunties, trans in the game, playstation gets a unique quest a year ahead every other platform and you cant kill any main characters whats so ever. Highly over hyped game. Its okay but just okay, you can get lost for hours in the world but the story falls completely flat towards the end same as the unforgiveable curses being pointless/ you only unlocked them towards the last few levels making them even more useless.",1
I cant run the game even on the lowest settings. I tried to refund the game but they denied my request. I have played about 15 minutes of the story and my character is still level 1. Most the hours I have logged are me trying to trouble shoot and fix this problem.,1
TYHIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS,1
"After 4 hours of troubleshooting, I could not get this game to run consistently above 10 FPS. I have a 2070 super, i7, and 16gb of DDR4 memory. It should not run as terribly as it did. The intro the game is otherwise pretty good, and I'd give it a positive rating if it weren't for the fact that the game was essentially unplayable (which is why I refunded it for the time being). I will purchase it in the future if the performance is improved on PC.",1
"So much for my wizzardly adventure. If only there was a spell for optimization. Oh! thats right! the developers never placed it in, not the spell nor actual optimization.With my RTX2060 on medium graphics i expected at least a smooth game. But got a stuttering frame dipping mess. The video game industry needs to do better! Another game that still needs to be in the oven. I went through several fixes online and it didn't resolve anything. I only wanted to play this game after long hours of schooling. Instead I got long hours of troubleshooting.",1
Glitchy as hell at the moment. Unplayable at times. Hopefully they will patch it.,1
"A PG theme park experience with little depth that feels very derivative and lazy. Combat in this style was done better years ago by Witcher 3 & Spiderman. Personally I really like how Shadows of War/Mordor made a whole game out of that combat style. In this game it feels awkward. They also try to emulate God of War's ""juggling"" enemies with similar results. I can't stress enough that the combat is absolutely the best part of this game too.Once you've solved a puzzle, its just about repeating the same solution over and over.Once you've learned a spell, you just need to repeat the same process for every other spell. When I say linear I mean you trace a line and press quicktime (slowtime) keystrokes to continue on the path you can't stray from even if you try. Different spells are only mysterious until you've used them to solve a puzzle. Different schools have different colors that enemies need to be targeted by to be vulnerable by -- so you just need to have one of each slotted to succeed at any time.Talents -- 5/6 for each discipline. Things you wish were included by default and not investment. That's the type of progression to expect though. Very slow and repetitive and the only reason to complete any sort of repetitious puzzle or grind is cosmetics - but this isn't an MMO.Nothing you do matters at all either. Which is what you would hope for when you forgo the MMO style of storytelling, right? Nothing you do matters, you're special and simultaneously its tough to care about your character because it's really just an awkward avatar and not written as part of the story.",1
this game crash every time i enter it my PC below perfect AND I PLAY THE GAME WITH EVERY THING LOW AND CLOSES EVERY THING THAT NEEDS MY GPU TO WORK MORE yet it still crashes,1
game good just it works like crap on steam,1

"For the sake of man of culture, I will rate this game as bad.Revelio spell does not reveal any undies or bras of other students.",1
"Its content is just copy-paste, bland and not something new to experience. It is mostly repetitive quests and activities that are already present in most games. The environment looks beautiful, but it feels extremely empty. There is a lot to look at, but most rooms are useless and just for show. Hogwarts Legacy is advertised as an immersive open-world experience, but it is quite the opposite. I was given the expression that I would be able to explore and have lots of quests and activities to find and do, in the open. Furthermore, the quests that are present in the open-world are mainly repetitive and boring collecting quests that are also present in most games. The main story also moves quite slow. I thought the story would be immersive and creative, but it is the common ""main character has special powers"" kind of story. Moreover, the combat is very boring and repetitive as well. Lots of the spells feel similar; they may have different animations and visual effects, but they simply have the exact same result. The combat felt fun at first, but it quickly got repetitive. You have to always do the exact same spells, and there are any special combos that make it feel unique and new. There is also a large amount of serious performance issues. There are always huge lag spikes, and I definitely have the recommend specs that were advertised to run this game. The menu loading is also too slow for a game that requires opening a menu every 5 seconds. It is obvious that the main reason why people like this game is the environment and setting. I agree that that was done well. The world feels very authentic and the developers did a very good job on completing that part. However, every other aspect in this game is unrefined and simply boring, repetitive or lacking. I understand that Harry Potter is a huge franchise, but I am surprised with the good reception this game received. How can so many people ignore the issues with this game, when it is so obviously seen and out in the open. Hogwarts Legacy simply does not match its videos, screenshots or the reviews advertised. I was enjoying my time at first, but it got repetitive and bland after a few hours.",1
"No Fishing, i rest my case",1
"I would hold off on purchasing this game until it is optimized if you are a PC user. I have many games that I can run at 4k quality 60fps and the other games I own are just barely sub 4k 60fps playable, this one however will barely run if I have most or even all of the settings on low. My main concern was tweaking the settings to a point where I could actually experience combat without stutter, lag, or freeze, unfortunately that makes it so I can't enjoy the amazing experience of flying around Hogwarts and the surrounding areas. I have tried every possible combination of settings and found one that works just well enough to let me walk around without trouble, but still having issues when transitioning between locations through doorways when it has to load a new section of the map.",1
game will not run just shows a black screen or crashes,1
CANT PLAY. THERE BUG IN OPENING THE GAME,1
"Dear Avalanche Software & Warner Bros. Games,I wanted to provide you with some feedback regarding the performance of Hogwarts Legacy on my system. While I am excited to have started my school year at Hogwarts, I have noticed that the game's performance has been less than ideal. Despite my system specifications, which include 32 GB RAM, RTX 3080, and a Ryzen 3700x, playing on 1440p middle-high settings, the performance of the game has not met my expectations. In particular, I have experienced significant performance issues while in Hogsmeade.I understand that game optimization can be a complex and ongoing process. I hope your team is currently working to improve the game's performance. While the patch released today did not seem to make any noticeable changes, I am hopeful that future updates will fix these issues.As a comparison, I have found Red Dead Redemption 2, another demanding game, to run smoothly throughout the whole game on ultra settings on my system. I believe that a game as highly anticipated as Hogwarts Legacy deserves the same level of optimization and performance as other top-tier games.At this time, I plan to leave a negative review on Steam until these performance issues are addressed. However, I sincerely hope that your team can improve the game's performance, as I believe it has the potential to be an excellent gaming experience.Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to an fully optimized Hogwarts Legacy.Best regardsX",1
"in my 10 hours of playtime i had what felt like 5 hours of cut-scenes, 2 hours of exploring, 2 hours of fetch quests and 1 hour of combat. id buy a visual novel if i wanted to do nothing but read/listen. combat is somewhat decent but gets repetitive after a short while, enemy variety is nonexistent (some enemy's are just recolors and resizes and get their own bestiary entry with the same attack-patterns, the bigger versions get a big attack that cant be blocked or parried and that's it.) tasks from teachers are just tedious. some puzzle quests literally show you how to beat them. it has some pros tho:Voice Acting is goodVisuals are impressive enoughSounddesign is excellentMusic is good (but after getting the same quip after picking up 80+ pages it does become rather annoying)in conclusion:feels like a ubisoft game the way you get bombarded with information if you like harry potter i can see why someone would like it, but if you couldn't care less about the setting and dislike ubisoft game design id stay clear of it.",1
its good but i have shits that run better,1
"Well, maybe you should play it.  Maybe it's just my computer but I should've bought this game on PS5!  I was thinking to myself that I have an almost top of the line alienware with the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D 8-Core Processor, 128 GB ram, the Radeon RX 6900 XT graphics card and an alienware 34 curved QD-OLED monitor that does HDR, why not get it on PC?  Plus I was able to find the digital deluxe edition for 59 dollars (code for steam).  I Should be able to max everything out right?  Maybe.  I played about 20 minutes of the game and most of it was with abysmal frame rates.  Turning HDR shouldn't be an option here.  Then I kept getting a black screen.  Audio was playing and I can alt/tab out but can't do anything.  I have to hard reset or shut down computer manually.  This went on for a few days and I racked up 4 hour play time!  Most of that was in black screen or trying to trouble shoot!  I waited for the new AMD drivers which were released today.  So I did the usual, windows update everything, all drivers, alienware updated/support assist driver update, microsoft store/library/get updates etc etc etc, clean install of the new AMD drivers was last.  I tried starting the game and guess what!  Black screen!  YAY!!  Saving grace was that I was actually able to alt/tab or just press the windows key and actually see my taskbar and cursor.Is it Alienware/Dell?  AMD?  The game itself?  Maybe a combo of 2 or all 3?  Who knows...so much for getting the deluxe edition to play early.",1
"if there ever comes a time you can get mods to replace certain species, i'll buy it again but for now.. nahThe opening story was great, it felt like I was watching another movie. However, once you get to the school and the magic of traditional England fades, you're left with stupid shit.",1
"Ran OK now it runs poorly, not sure what this patch did but don't buy it now if you were wating",1
"pretty fun game, unfortunately 16 gb of ram is simply not enough to run the game well at the moment. with my 16 gb ram, 2070 super and ryzen 5 5600x i cannot run this game for the life of me. task manager shows this game using 9-12 gb of ram and it makes the game extremely laggy on all graphics settings, unable to hold even 30 fps with regular frame drops. hopefully this will be optimized soon, at the moment it is unplayable after you arrive at hogwarts.",1
"Very stuttery game, to the point of near unplayable. The 2/14/23 patch didn't help at all, setting my graphics settings to minimum didn't help, nor did any community patch.Specifically when trying to move or perform actions the game will break from 60fps and stutter like crazy. I assume the game struggles to load anything",1
"The absolute MOST unoptimized game I have EVER wasted money on! My computer is MORE than enough to play this game  (runs CyberPunk with no issues) But this game lags and teleports and rubber bands so much you literally have to take vast amounts of Dramamine just to avoid puking! DO NOT waste your money on this shit right now. I get the whole Hogwarts fan base, I love it too, but right now this is 100% a waste of cash!",1
Hate to see a GOTY candidate ruined by performance issues.,1
"PC performance is inexcusably bad. RTX 3070, 5800x3D. My rig runs any game flawlessly in 1440p, this game stutters so badly it is extremely obnoxious. Horrible PC port. Wait for a patch.",1
Can't recommend this game until they fix the stuttering and massive frame drops.,1
"I can't recommend Hogwarts Legacy at the current price of ?50.This game is feels really rushed. The first half is incredible, the prologue was a completely unexpected cinematic gem, Hogwarts itself is a joy to explore, the initial lessons offer nice flavour about the spells you're about to learn, the characters are unique (albeit a bit cliche) and you're really feeling that 'I'm a student at hogwarts' vibe. Then you get your broom and the game becomes a generic open world RPG as if Harry Potter himself has joined the Assassin Brotherhood. Everything that makes the first half so interesting is gone, lessons are uninspired cutscenes and you then you learn an unrelated spell after, the world is littered with repetitive tasks/collectibles, characters become the same blend of 'good-natured but incompetent' and quests become 'go to dungeon, kill baddie, retrieve thing'. The final half of the story lets down the great introduction by offering no meaningful choices and an unemotional, obvious finale. Itemisation is shockingly poor. I picked up a 'legendary' item within my first hour of play which was discarded by a basic item in the next hour. There's no interesting item attributes to focus or balance just offence and defence when you could have had spell cooldown, damage, critical, debuff, stealth detection etc... The talent system also felt pretty shallow with most of the spell talents just adding an AoE component. The inability to unlock every talent and/or respec is just criminal. Personally I felt the potions should have been harder to obtain but with longer durations/more powerful effects. It just became an chore to brew them and apply them constantly. It would have been much cooler to hunt down a rare creature for a material, to brew into a potion that gave me a 5 minute buff or even something permanent. Witcher 3 is really best in show for this. That being said, I found the combat plants a fun thematic inclusion.Combat was generally quite fun and a challenge at times. The air-time mechanic was probably my favourite aspect of the combat. It did however feel like there were really only two classes of enemies - those that could be crowd controlled and those that couldn't. The controls for combat were not great and found myself messing up whilst trying to switch up spell slots on the fly.Credit where is credit is due, the world is beautiful. Hogwarts obviously is the masterpiece but there are really fantastic sets throughout the world. Overall this game has great potential and I hope the success it has achieved will inspire fundamental changes in DLC or a much deeper sequel.",1
how is desync possible in a singleplayer gamewow this blew up follow for more bangers,1
"The visual elements are stunning and that's about it.  The story line reads like a power wank fan fiction.  The controls are clunky and pretty much impossible when it comes to flight.  The clothing system is frustrating and requires constant management to get the best perks and if you don't want to end up looking like an escaped inmate from an asylum you have to adjust your outfit every time you do so.   Tab also does not open your inventory, like it would in practically every other game in existence, it is your consumable/grenade option.  Which goes to show just how little thought went into things.All in all, fun in the beginning, but becomes frustrating as the difficulty and complexity of the game increases and the shortfalls of the control layout become more and more apparent.",1
please fix ur game,1

Do not buy this game for PC is so laggy is unplayable,1
Game is mediocre but runs like crap on pc.,1
"Recent patch literally bricked my game, can't move the camera now without the game freezing.",1
No PVP >_>,1
"Well, Hogwarts Legacy is a videogame. It has graphics. It has sound and music. It has story and characters. It has quests. It has combat, exploration, puzzles. It's also terribly mediocre with a bunch of clearly subpar moments / parts thrown in for good measure. The inexperience of the dev team shines straight through with outdated gameplay elements and designs with some basic convenience things - such as a goddamn watch / time of day information in a game with day/night cycle - missing entirely. It feels and plays like open world games from 10-15 years ago, except with a lot less of the good elements of those games - this is ""Far Cry 3: The less fun and you are a wizard, Harry edition"".Honestly, the game that comes to mind the most is Forspoken. Take Forspoken, decrease the cringe by 25%, make the hub location decent and even immersive at first glance, and voila - Hogwarts Legacy. If this game had all of the HP lore taken out, and was renamed to Student Wizard Simulator, or somesuch name, I guarantee you the Steam reviews would be at best mixed right now, and there would be a looot less of them.This is a 20 USD/EUR game for HP fans, and game pass for anyone else. Also, it has all of the ""for modern audiences"" things, there's no need for the boycott by those who are into that sort of thing.Okay, that's the short review, now comes the wall of text, so unless you have way too much time on your hands, go away. Shoo. Get lost.Alright, let's go into some depth and no worries, no spoilers here.Let's start with graphics - they are okay. Again, only the castle itself is truly spectacular, the rest of the designs, objects, animations, etc. is good, but nothing special, and it can be very very bland at times. If it weren't for the clothing and the wand, you'd mistake a lot of the game with Breakpoint, and that is, as you all know, definitely not a good thing. On the other hand, and I simply have to say it again, the castle is exceptionally well designed and built. And I guess Hogsmeade is pretty well done too.Now with sound, the sounds are pretty generic and bland, honestly. The voiceovers are very hit and miss in quality, the amount of enemy chatter lines during combat is very limited and is one of the factors that break immersion in combat, the story character voiceovers for some characters are great, but others feel as if the actor was forced to do them and really did not want to, etc. The music, with the exception of a few tracks, is very bland and forgettable too, and fails to elicit any emotion what so ever.The RPG elements - are meh. The game is more of an immersive sim, to be honest. Skills and such that you can upgrade are there, but the selection is fairly restricted, and so are their effects. Furthermore, everything in the world scales to your level, with the exception of some main quest encounters (not all though), which absolutely kills any sense of progression in the game, and makes grinding actually hurt you, because the enemies scale to your level, but also to what level your equipment SHOULD be - not what it is, so you constantly have to buy new equipment to keep up, and the income in this game is very limited, so if you grind skills, you have to then grind money. Best to not grind anything beyond some of the level-gated minimums.Speaking of immersive sim, is the world immersive? If you run around without stopping and pay the absolute minimum of attention, yeah. Stop for two seconds and it blows apart like a house of cards hit with a Bombarda. Technical issues with characters spawning right in front of you and despawning when you turn around ?-la CP2077 aside, the NPCs don't track their lines at all, so you get NPCs that contradict themselves. For example a dialogue I witnessed, a Gryff NPC goes ""Though my brother would be a Slytherin, but he is a Gryff like I am."" and a Puff NPC responds some non-response and the Gryff NPC continues with ""Oh, all of my family is Puffs, only I am a Gryff"", to which the Puff starts talking about something completely off-topic, and the Gryff responds with a question that is yet again about another topic, and then walks off, without hearing a response to their own question.Their range of animations and interactions is also very limited and they just stand around or walk around aimlessly, turning around and walking back in random locations - again, very much like CP2077. None of them really interact with the world at all. The great hall is full of people eating the whole damn day, except at night when everyone just despawns. NPCs don't really walk into the hall, have a seat, and eat at appropriate times, they either spawn there, or they spawn to walk around endlessly around the castle or the grounds with a few scripted events to break the mold a bit - but not enough.You can't really interact with anyone either, with a very few exceptions, and there are no games or school activities aside from scripted events at certain parts in the story, and so on. The world also does not react to you at all. Sure, they drop a few lines when you do something noteworthy during a quest, but they do not react to you in the here and now at all. You can literally go to stores, take their stuff from their chests and take bags of gold lying about, and the shopkeeper just stares at you dumbly and does nothing. Like really? Go try doing that in Morrowind, an actual RPG from what - 20 years ago?The enemy variety is also very small, and all of the enemies in the same class look exactly the same and most of their designs also are not all that interesting, so it always feels like you are fighting a clone army, or an NPC army really, breaking any immersion. The enemies also do not really roam the world, 80% of them is restricted to specific spawn locations, and the remaining 20% follows a pre-set patrol path. That's all.Oh and the best thing - at night, the NPCs in the castle simply all despawn. They are not sleeping, there are not patrols in the castle (outside of missions or special events), everyone just disappears and you have the whole castle to yourself. Not even the ghosts appear, lmao.Anyways, moving on - the combat is again bland and boring. The enemies have way too much health to compensate for the fact that their AI is bad and the dev team could not think of any way to make it interesting. It's just spam attack with occasional dodge/parry and a few higher damage skills thrown into the mix. Or instakill stealth, until it isn't and you only do 50% damage to enemies and can't stealth anymore. This happened randomly, no idea why. Anyways, again - it's just generic and bland. Nothing special, nothing interesting.And I could go on for almost forever. Honestly, the game should have been smaller, and more in depth. The locations should have been reduced to the castle, the immediate grounds with the quiditch pitch, the forbidden forest, and hogsmeade, with the occasional mid sized linear dungeons that the game has being accessible from the castle itself or via cutscene-travel instead of being strewn about a boring bland mess of mud and the same tree model over and over again with the same goblin and wolf enemies everywhere.With more focus on what is 100% the core of the game, the castle itself and the people within, with the immediate surroundings and that being spiced up with the occasional dungeon, we'd have a great game on our hands. Likely not without its issues given the lack of experience of the devs, but still a really good game. However, as it is, we have just another run of the mill Ubisoft-tier game carried heavily by its name.The technical state is pretty poor, and the game has issues with everything from inconsistent loading times to texture streaming issues to stutter to sound issues to crashing to desktop and so on. Any technical issue you can think of, this game most likely has it.And lastly, the game is chock-full of woke garbage, with demographics and politics of London 2023.",1
"Good game, bad PC port",1
"Can't really recommend the game at full price, unless you're a real fan of the Harry Potter universe.  For those looking to stroll through an adventure in the 'wizarding world' you're in for a treat.  Probably.  For context, I used the money spent on Forespoken to play this game, after refunding Forespoken.The game itself is fine, generic almost.  It takes many solid ideas and executes them well enough.  But what it doesn't do is present any new ideas, tell a new story, or provide much depth.  The spell combat works fine, the interactions follow the usual tropes, and there are few surprises as the game unfolds.  There should be an option to limit much of the repeated dialogue as you venture through the game; being told that all roads seem to lead to Hogsmeade for the 100th time gets quite old.  The game opens up well, allowing you to warp, walk, or fly to most destinations.  Walking becomes a thing that only happens for the sake of the story, unless you're truly dedicated to wandering the paths with the other inconsequential NPCs.  The challenges encountered while wandering the open world seem relatively trivial, with the benefits that they provide having little to no real influence on the game itself.  Increasing my inventory doesn't mean a whole lot and leaving that responsibility to Merlin feels like a last minute ""I don't know what else to do with this"" move (Merlin, who was famous well before Harry Potter was ever conceived).  The loot itself is largely inconsequential, and the items themselves fall into one of a few pallet swaps or changes to wardrobe accessories.  The performance issues seem to have gone unaddressed, and have largely become worse since I began playing it.  After a patch I have been informed twice now that it would take up to half a year in order to finish installing the patch.As I have played well beyond the mark for refund I will likely simply finish it to ensure I received fair dollar value.  I don't begrudge anyone that does enjoy this game, and this review is not negative for any reason than I wish I'd purchased it on sale rather than full price due to relatively bland gameplay.  But hey... in the end, you get to be wizard/witch.",1
game is almost unplayable on lowest settings. PC optimization is disgusting and the new update did nothing to help that. FIX YOUR GAME,1
"In it's current state, I would be hesitant to purchase this, if I hadn't already. At first, it runs beautifully. As soon as I arrived at Hogwarts. every NPC and my character lost all texture and detail in their faces. All of the texture in the scenery around me was awful and pixelated. I played with some settings and got the game to run decently after this but as soon as I stepped foot into Hogsmeade, my FPS tanked and the graphics were just as bad as before I fixed them. Once the game is (hopefully) patched and optimized, I will rewrite my review to focus more on the gameplay and experience. As of now 2/14/23, I would not recommend purchasing unless you have the best of the best gaming computer!",1
"Poor as a game, the best as a HP fan game. Probably would have done well as a game from ten years ago.Mechanics seem outdated, boring game interactions. Story was well done, but barely any flexibility with the game experience.Not worth the current price tag. But a good one time experience. Would recommend when the price drops at least to half of the current.",1
Terrible performance issues. The game won't even load past the shaders.,1
"This game is an absolute disaster! It's riddled with constant slowdowns and stuttering, rendering it practically unplayable. And to make matters worse, the colors in the game look disgustingly washed out, completely ruining any sense of immersion. It's utterly unacceptable that they're charging full price for a game that's so blatantly unfinished and unpolished. I had high hopes for this game, but it's turned out to be nothing more than a complete and utter letdown. I'm beyond furious that I wasted my hard-earned money on this mess.",1
Can't play the game because of heavy stuttering. Fix your game and i will change the review to something positive. Money hungry corp.,1
Runs terribly with the own game's recommended settings and with everything on Low.,1
"game is great, optimization is awful",1
UPDATE ON 2.14.23 BROKE THE GAME DON'T BUY UNTIL FIXED,1
"Let me get this out of the way: the game itself is fantastical and fun, moment to moment. Sure, ""choices"" in the game do not amount to much in the long run, and you're only seeing a couple different quests and characters between the four houses, but I really don't mind that. Being in the game world itself is what's the main driving force of excitement here. Spells are flashy, the combat can be brutal and fluid at the same time.But, I cannot recommend buying this game right now based on the performance alone.Today is 2/14 and a patch was released to combat some performance issues... but, what performance issues were addressed here? The game still runs at 45-52 FPS in most locations (Hogsmeade and most of the school) but I will get into areas that can hit up to 80 FPS out in the open world just fine. The performance across the board here is wildly inconsistent.Running well above the recommended RAM for the game, 3080 Ti, 3900x Ryzen CPU, 32GB of 3200mhz DDR-4 RAM and on a fast NVME drive.  Some of the performance tweaks out there make very little if no impact at all on the performance here. However, I have friends running lower spec cards and CPU's that are getting better performance than me at similar resolutions. It makes me think that this game's issues may be fixed with a Game Ready driver or with a bit more time and attention from the developers.It's such a shame because what is here blows a lot of other open world games out of the water on presentation alone. But, again, the inconsistencies with performance on this leave a lot to be desired.I'll update here once the game runs like a 2023 release should. Additional kudos to WB and Portkey for not loading this game up with microtransactions.",1
"have played this game for 3 hours but it keeps crashing, i have a 3060 rtx followed by r5 3600, and i still get crashed. i would not recommend this game to anyone before they get this fixed.",1
"way way way too linear, not enough customization options, bad optimization, horrible story, boring dialogues, horrible writing horrible characters. the gameplay is just not good enough to redeem this game. 5/10",1
This game worked for 2 sessions. then wont load. I have been trying for 2 hours. apparently a lot of  people are having this issue. it wont offer a fix it just wont load. waste of time and money,1
"The game itself is a treat for Potter fans and the fan service and love for even small details is commendable, but the performance and optimization (or lack thereof) is an absolute joke.Frame drops into the single digits, stuttering everywhere, combat sometimes being nigh impossible due to the atrocious lag/lag spikes - it's pathetic what the developers have delivered here.Besides these glaring issues there's also the overkill on open world 'activities' the world is filled with. Repetitive, boring and straight up way too many puzzles that, mini-games that shouldn't be mini-games and more paired with the general lack of liveliness in the inhabitants of the Wizarding World - the NPCs and even the player character - make for a game that feels empty while being filled to the brim with nonsense.If you can overlook a questionable and unfortunately very bland story and simply want to experience the wizarding shenanigans the game has to offer [b]I'd still highly recommend waiting until Avalanche finally fixed the disgusting performance issues[/b] that so far entirely kill any and all fun that could have been had in this game.",1
"its a good game i give it a 7.5/10 but they need to fix the lag in this game because i havent been lagging since the 7th of feb but now all of a sudden i am, i dont eve want to play the game cux of the lag",1
I'm not a they.,1
"great detail, big transphobia, big antisemitic tendencies, terrible optimization. not worth $60.",1
"I purchased this game with the expectation that we would be playing a lore accurate game, and as it is set in the 1800's, I was disappointed to discover that the game included toilets. Imagine how fun it would be if they included a lore-accurate minigame wherein your character takes a fat, smelly wizard dump and then has to Disapperate it or else people start to complain about the smell. Imagine if you could turn this to your advantage and have your magical bowel leavings ready to summon onto the faces of opponents or just people who annoy you in game. I guess the development team just lacks imagination.",1
there is too many bugs glitches and plus i chant rescue biscuit quest somebody help meeee i donth know what the hell to do i already finish game without completing the biscuits quest and its still in cage.im not going to start new game   fix the problem,1
The game was great for the 2+ hours that I played it. Turned off my computer then tried to load the game up the next day. Now all I get is the directx error. Tried everything to fix. I would stay away from this game until they fix this issue.It was a great game until this issue happened and now I can't play it.,1
"Overall a bad game, if you want to achievement grind something its there, but even then, the bugs are so abundant it can lock a few achievements and make 100% impossible.",1
"Putting aside the excitement from it being an open-world Harry Potter game, it feels bland and soulless. The first four hours of the game are mostly dialogue and exposition, yet not a single character is interesting in any way or has any personality, and their lines are delivered flatly at best. The main character's voice sounds like it's an android speaking, no matter which voice you choose (as well as being delivered flatly). I also have to wait for the doors to open onto the school grounds while the game loads the outside environment every time. Many portraits don't move in the slightest, while ones in their neighboring frames do. Then when you return to the same area an hour later, it's the opposite. I walk past the Hogwarts Floo Flame lady and after about the twentieth time, I had realized how few lines of dialogue she has. So few that I'd prefer she didn't speak at all instead of continually delivering the same lines. My character for some reason is forever cross-eyed, and it's impossible not to notice while I'm dozing from the flat dialogue. It could be they decided to give cross-eyed representation. But, knowing this game's and the developers' reputation, that'd be laughable. Take that and combine it with the plot-line being nonsensical and one-note (good wizards vs scary, evil goblin). There are a few small things with which you can interact that are (briefly) neat, in and around the castle, until you stop spinning one of the globes and notice there are islands mapped out on said globe that weren't discovered until decades after the game's setting. Which you could dismiss and say they're wizards and they discovered and mapped it before muggles. But I won't give it the benefit of the doubt, knowing how many plot-holes are in the book series as a whole.Most of the people in Hogwarts are having their own limited conversations with each other as you're walking past; however, you can't directly interact or converse with the majority of them. If the upper echelon of the spectrum is Red Dead Redemption 2 with how much interactivity and detail there is with the world and NPCs, this is on the opposite end.For an example, compare this with the Witcher 3, another open-world game based on a world from which there are seven books, such as Harry Potter. The two have similar ratings at the moment. The quality of the writing, dialogue, story, world, etc., is incomparable. Most of the Witcher is dialogue, just people talking to each other. And it's always riveting. The side-quests are some the best-written stories I've experienced in a game, and in Hogwarts Legacy the side-content mostly boils down to using Accio on flying pieces of paper and using Lumos on moths. It does have the benefit of having a book series with more depth and lore, being written by a writer that is significantly better than JK Rowling, but the writing and the quests in the game originated almost entirely within the writers' room of CD Projekt RED. This game does have better combat than the Witcher, but that's it, and there's so little of it. But the combat itself isn't even amazing; it doesn't compare to more recent games such as Elden Ring, God of War, Nioh, Ghost of Tsushima, etc.The game shouldn't receive a pass on mediocrity because it's Harry Potter. The books received a pass on mediocre writing because Hogwarts and the characters (Hermione, Dumbledore, Luna, etc) were so lovable, and because the books evoked a wistful longing for everyone reading it, a longing to receive that invitational letter via owl, so we can trade our harsh, bleak realities for such a whimsical and magical world. This game evoked nothing in me but disappointment and annoyance.",1
boring plastic excuse of game,1
"Hogwarts Legacy is a great open-world action-adventure game but it is a very shallow RPG game. I unfortunately cannot recommend it as it falls flat as an RPG. [Progression]?	No stats besides offense/defense, which means no skill checks and no extensive stats on gear. No item set bonuses, or unique effects/bonuses.?	Very linear story gameplay, choices are usually ¡°Yes/No¡± or ¡°Glad to help/Pay me for helping¡±. At the end, the game literally asks you if you want the ¡°good¡± or the ¡°bad¡± ending. Your choices along the way have little accumulative impact. This is a far cry from Mass Effect where individual choices throughout the playthrough have a resonating effect.?	You begin accumulating talent points at around level 6 but due to how easily you can level up by grabbing the field guides, it¡¯s not uncommon to see people unlock the talent tree at level 15 which is terrible pacing.?	The character will make the same ¡°oh wow I killed a dark wizard¡± comment at level 30 as they did at level 7.[Economy]?	A level 6 legendary item and a level 30 item costs the same ? 500 Galleons. Why doesn¡¯t it scale with your level??	One Thunderbrew potion is 1000 Galleons. Why is one temporary potion worth two best-in-slot items??	No option to sell potions or materials gathered.?	All beasts sell for the same price, a Phoenix should be worth more than a Niffler.[Stealth]?	Poorly designed, primitive and overpowered skill tree. Borderline exploitative in combat once fully upgraded. An AoE stealth kill? Really??	Useless outside of combat ? there is no crime system. The quest that introduces lockpicking talks about using stealth in tandem with lockpicking to avoid getting caught. Which is great if NPCs actually cared about you lockpicking buildings, which they don¡¯t. You can literally rob Hogsmeade in broad daylight and no one will bat an eye.[Friendly NPCs]?	No assigned beds and no sleep schedule. This goes together with lockpicking ? there are no NPCs sleeping in beds or even existing in homes. You break into someone¡¯s house in the middle of the night, the lights are on but no one¡¯s home. ?	Hogwarts students don¡¯t sleep at night and disappear when the sun sets like reverse vampires. ?	No pathing in Hogsmeade, NPCs stand in a circle saying the same thing over and over to each other.?	I¡¯ve seen countless times identical NPCs spawn next to each other, lacking in variety.[World Building]?	All of the little hamlets found in the world are indistinguishable from one another. The NPCs in one hamlet say the same things as the NPCs at Hogwarts or any other hamlet.?	Dungeons all start to blend together, due to little enemy variety. All of them have a chest with random loot that you¡¯ve been looting for hours. (I¡¯ve gotten the First Year Cap head item over and over again countless times, as an example).[Play Time Fluffers]?	With selling gear being the main source of income, the devs had purposefully made the inventory slots for gear in your bag be very limited. They want you to complete ¡°Trials of Merlin¡± to increase your bag space OR port back to a vendor to sell your items. There are over 90 Trials of Merlin. ?	Demiguise, Field Pages, Astronomy Tables, etc. all feel like they are designed to pad play time without any real impact.?	Lockpicking game is unnecessary.Overall it¡¯s a pretty and fun action-adventure game but it was marketed as an RPG that lets you immerse yourself as a Hogwarts student and that you can ¡°go down a dark path¡± if you so choose. But that is not true and the experience is very hollow. The game feels a bit childish as there is little at stake here; there are no house rivalries and no rude friendly NPCs (besides the headmaster). It¡¯s a very ¡°on the rails¡± rollercoaster ride that errs on the side of ¡°slow and safe¡±, not taking risks or being particularly exhilarating. It sure is graphically stunning though, and no one can deny that.",1
"I have been waiting to post a review until an update has come along... well, it's here.. game still runs like crap.  RTX3070ti, Ryzen 7 5800x, Samsung pro nvme, 32GB RAM 3600MHz.  Im not running ray tracing and am only getting between 16 and 48 fps.  FIX THE GAME ALREADY!! Game is great!! Performance sucks..",1
Game randomly decided to stop seeing my save file. Now all 20 hours of progress is gone and theres no way to start my character again even though I still have an UNCORRUPTED save file.,1
literlly the bigest pos on the planet i saved and logged off lvl 20 and logged back on and it was gone not sending another fucking dime on warner bro products again!,1
"great game, however if your like me, it will let you play for over 40 hours, and then lose your save file entirely. hours on hours of game time gone",1
"The gameplay is satisfying and fun, I'm enjoying the professors so far (tho the students are entirely one-dimensional props for side-questing and world filler and add no sense of immersion, but I'm hoping this changes at some point further on).Performance-wise, I'm extremely underwhelmed. Constant fog, in-and-outdoors, washes out the entire game. Tons of pop-in and slow-loading textures breaks immersion. Had to download a mod and a RAM cache limiter to stop the ridiculous amount of stuttering and fps drops. The entire game looks blurry, but also uses tons of RAM (recommends 16GB and uses every heckin' bit of it) so ReShade was out, and I am thus using nvidia sharpening so I don't feel like my glasses are smudged the entire time I'm playing. My friend lost her entire progress when her save files just stopped showing up after a crash, and the same is happening to others, tho some are luckily able to retrieve their data through fairly janky fixes, but not all. Despite plenty of forum posts, steam discussions, reddit threads, and modders doing their best to make fixes, the studio hasn't bothered making a statement or releasing any patches yet. TL;DR: Fun game, but has tons of issues, some involving losing ALL PROGRESS randomly and irrevocably. Cannot recommend in current state. Please for your own sake, wait until the first major patch at least to buy this game.",1
"this game is pretty great, fun beautiful, have a nice vibe to enjoy...but im leaving a negative review because its performance is horrible. im on a high end custom rig and my fps is horrible and all over the place. turns out for those who don't know this game has Denuvo, for anti cheating but its killing the performance. everytime i boot this game up I turn off and think maybe they'll update soon. as of now i feel i wasted my money because it makes me physically nauseous to play. the wonky fps just gets me so queasy. really hope this gets patched asap and ill change review because it is a good game from what i have played. also sometimes id get a steady 60+ fps (for like 45 seconds here & there) and it was awesome. so if this is fixed id def change my review and recommend but as of now id suggest console, even tho it would tone the visuals down.",1
Game is soft locked on broom quest 14 hrs in and screwed,1
"Game crashes on loading screen after the tutorial part, despite many attempts of changing settings and all of that stuff. I have the recommended settings of hardware and I play many other games from Steam that requires high graphics.I LOST A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THIS.",1
"Sadly, Sorting Hat put me to Stutterpuff. Even after the first update. Can't say that my Nimbus 2000 couldn't handle decent performance either: 5800x3d, 32gb of ram, gen 4 ssd and 3080 FE.RT is a laggy mess regardless of settings, stutters are totally random and I'm tired of the devs' habit to remedy any native res rendering problems with DLSS/FSR. Fan fixes helped with a few FPS here and there, but they are not some sort of Ultimate Spell to massively cure pop-in and slowdowns in populated areas. Yes, on my PS5 it's 30fps w/o RT, but it looks pretty enough and I get zero stutters in any modes there with way more modest hardware on board.Don't get me wrong here. The game is fantastic! But PC version at the moment is as painful, as Crucio spell. Wait for PC port to be patched (or developed?) thoroughly.",1

Requires a monster behemoth of a computer to run. After 6 years I guess it's time to upgrade lol,1
"I can't fault the game play, story, mechanics or world but the performance is horrendous. It's very inconsistent and depreciates the immense fun there is to be had with the game.Wait for a solid future update before parting with your hard earned cash.",1
"As the game is now I would not recommend getting it there are a lot of performance issues that need to be fixed by properly optimizing the game and the npc's are complete garbage, it feels like they just took npc's from skyrim and put them in this game which is awful since skyrim came out in 2011. Although I do see a lot of potential as I have still enjoyed the game so far. The combat feels very smooth and the open world aspect is amazing, I also really enjoy the story both main and the side stories you go through with the different character you come across. If they can fix optimization and npc's then id say this could be GOTY. So i'd say don't buy it now, wait a few months for it to go on sale and for the devs to patch the game.",1
"Terrible performance; even after the update. It has everything that I was looking for, but I cannot recommend this game until they fix the performance issues.",1
"I was very excited for this game, but having bashed it for maybe a week (I pre-ordered the Deluxe edition) I can give a pretty definitive opinion on it. Maybe this was because of how excited I was for the game or something along those lines, but in my right mind I just CANNOT recommend this game.Initially, I sold it to my friends as ""the game that could be a 10/10 if you can look past the terrible voice acting - otherwise it's a strong 9/10"". Well... that opinion has changed quite drastically...Well its a cumulation of things, for the good, the combat is great, the puzzles are interesting enough where participating in them is fun, the collectibles aren't anal and the customisation for the most part is pretty fucking there.The ISSUES with the game are quite extensive, the minor being of course the shit voice acting that comes from the kids and the lockpicking, the pet/breeding mechanic is a bit iffy and rather boring - feels like a second thought activity as it's rather lacklustre and useless really. The main character - I know he's a 5th year - but he looks so fucking old, his enthusiasm is dead, like literally man has less of a personality than a wet paper bag. The way I finished the game, and was not in any way emotionally engaged with any of the characters gives you an idea of the sort of story telling. The UI feels ridiculously like it was designed for a Multiplayer game so I have a pretty good inkling that due to scope creep they changed their idea for the project. The quests for the most part give you two conversation options - aside from the ""investigate"" sorta questions - you have the bully and the nice guy answers. They are great, really well written, but for the most part they just mean nothing, you can roleplay a twat but it doesn't change anything, some sidequests have affects to that one NPC but that's it. Hell, there is a sort of ""BIG CHOICE"" at the end of the campaign, but guess what? no matter what your voice option it matters not, as you won't see any kind of interactions with what your character said they would do. Using any of the mounts (minus the broom) feels awkward, and for the most part there is no benefit than just for cinematic effect. The way you can't save transmogs sets is a ballache and all in all I didn't have a single hat equipped through the game as they just FUGLY af.Oh and the combat feels and plays fluid and is generally top notch, but I have to say, it feels like a braindead activity towards the end of the game, no one can kill me and a 25 cap of healing potions doesn't particularly make the game challenging, as each potion brew's in 15 secs and you get mats really easily.Heck the last few bosses were nothing more than ""spell sponges""? There was nothing interesting to them aside from the visuals. A real shame for a game that looks, smells and feels like a masterpiece, but in reality it's just a trash game obfuscated in illusions, customisations and a really cool world...It's a GREAT Wizarding World simulation, but the story, and the gameplay loop make it ridiculously boring.",1

I tried running it on low, and that still stutters more than a 3rd grader, today a patch came out that supposedly fixes the performance issues, doesnt do ANYTHING.

Then I closed the game for an hour to go out, started the game up again and the graphics are unloadable again. No settings changes make any difference. Everything on the game is washed out, the faces are deformed and the floors are wonky. Unplayable.

A few things that threw me off :  A visual glitch on one of the balconies that I can't seem to clear up with settings.   The bar tenders voice just doesn't seem to match the character, made me wince.  A cross wands glitch lead to all my shots going to the same character regardless of who was highlighted or if target lock was on or off, or even if he was dead.  Restarting the match did not fix this at all.   Dialog where the main character says something to him/her self then the npc just repeats the same thing 2 seconds later.   Simplistic, not even a puzzle, type quests that just make you wonder, what am I doing with my life?  I love the IP, and will obviously keep plugging away at it I guess to get the member berry fix.  Hope it gets better, sometimes first impressions can change.",1
"It's an ""O.K."" game in the $39 range, but not at $60!  It's got too many bugs with frame-rates even with a stupendous graphics card.  The graphics level is poorly done (outside of the land/objects/NPCs) I was so underwhelmed by my characters graphical options and the terrible frame-rates that after I had given up trying to find the problems and fixing them that I decided to return the game.  But, (of course) I had spent well over my allotted 2 hours of ""game-play"" and steam would no longer honor a refund request.  Save yourself the headaches and wait for a few months while they actually ready this game for release to the public!  Worst case scenario you will save some money!",1

"Gameplay, World, Story, Quests... everything is awesome but the performance is so bad on a RTX 2070 Super thats why i can't blindly upvote it until this issues are worked out.

"Extreme frame rate struggles, feels poorly optimised. Had to apply Reddit fixes to make it playable. Hoping for a patch or two to fix.Sad as the game itself feels fantastic!",1
"This would be a great game if they didn't rush the release now every issue they ""fix"" crashes everything else. I have two pcs and it ran decent on my laptop which has a lower processor than my gaming pc, but it crashes bc of the memory card. My gaming pc makes everyone look like ps1 characters even if my specs are set to ultra.DO NOT BUY UNTIL RESOLVED. This is a waste of money and space and I wish I could play it so badly but everything looks like crap or runs like crap, might try and get a refund and buy on xbox or ps5 i guess.",1
"I was excited when it came out and bought deluxe pack. It was so nice playing this game tutorial until i see cinematic of train and then it freezes . Then Hogwards title showed on freeze screen and then it crashes. I tried to fix it like lower my graphic card setting  ( it was medium). I have 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700F @ 2.50GHz   2.50 GHz. RAM 16.0 GB (15.8 GB usable). Nvdia GeForce RTX 3060. I tried verifying game file. To no avil, there was just no point as game kept crashing. I am gonna refund this game and will reconsider buying it again if they fix it. P.S that most of the time of 1.4 hr is just me trying to start the game again and again to try to see if it was my end. :(",1
"The game is over all kinda boring. unfortunately, i dont feel only two hours of play before a refund is quite long enough to make a good call about liking the game or not. So, i have surpassed my opportunity to get the money back.. One thing i dont like about 1 player games is that alot of them tend to be very linear. as in, no replay ability. you beat it, you are done. this is true with this game. kind of lame. But, harry potter is cool, so i thought id give it a try. No quidditch is probably the worst move in my own opinion. When i saw Professor black say it was canceled for the season, which was a clever little way of the devs putting it in game without putting it in game, I kind of got an impulse right then to uninstall. But, thought id do a little more. I think people who like this game is just for the harry potter aesthetic the game has. Skin deep, is all it is. The actual content really isnt that good. I also dont like how your character personality and voice are extremely limited. I figured they would take that into account seeing as how each house as major personality differences because they fit into those houses based on who they are, because all four houses have major strengths in their personality. But, your character does not reflect that. Neither does the npcs in game. In a nutshell, shallow game. especially without quidditch. its visually pleasing. but, thats about it.",1
"Terrible performance and stuttering no matter what settings you have the game on, unplayable even after 2 patches. I put the game on the lowest settings with AMD FSR2 on and still the game runs high FPS and drops to 0 FPS for 1 second with long hitches constantly.So glad I have the Deluxe Edition for ""Early Access""...Probably a decent game in there, shame I can't play it after over a week of no fixes after release.",1
I bought this Sunday night played it for about 3 hours working fine fast-forward Tuesday afternoon updated the game and not it doesn't even fucking load just infinite black screen fix your fucking game,1
"The game itself seems fun but it seems like random people are having performance/optimization issues. I will be at 130+ frames and my game will start stuttering to the point where the game will be frozen for about 5-10 seconds. Unfortunately is happens as im moving through the castle and when I am in battle making the game pretty unplayable. My specs are way higher than the recommended requirements and after reading online it seems like there is issues with the way the game utilizes your CPU, problems with the ray tracing anti-aliasing, and the upscaling. As I said earlier this does not happen to everyone so I am not sure what determining factor is. For this reason only I will be thumbs downing the review but I know in due time there will be a fix.",1
Unplayable. I have 4 hours into a game that I have not actually played because it keeps crashing.The game is on the 2nd update but is is still unplayable.,1
Not sure if I'm the only one running into this issue or not. This game does not play nice with discord and repeatedly force closes both when I run them together.,1
"I want to give this games a thumbs up so bad as my first 30 hours of this game were wonderful. The combat is highly fun, I love the spells, the exploration, getting to fly around and especially the room of requirement and all the time I've gotten to spend decorating/customizing it and brewing up a bunch of potions. HOWEVER, after the last two patches, my game has become progressively worse. There used to be occasional stuttering and dropped frames (very seldom), but now I'm holding in the single digits most of the time. Hopefully they release a patch to fix the performance issues so I can actually get back to enjoying this game.",1
"Not ready for release. Huge frame rate losses on automatic benchmark settings (high), RTX 3070. I have to drop it to medium settings with all post processing off to be mostly stable. I still get drops to single digit frames in some places. The difference from high to medium is quite drastic and makes it feel like a 10 year old game. The voice acting and music is very good. Story has been good so far (60 hours) if you're willing to overlook several plot holes. Wait a few more months for them to sort out the mess if you can.",1
"game is laggy, refund policy is 2 hours of play time. .. it was bareable up until hogsmeade, which takes longer than 2 hours to get to. what a waste of money. hopefully gets better, dont purchase this game yet.  I have a top notch gaming PC, no reason this game should lag, when i can run cyberpunk at 60fps +",1
"preformance is terrible 3060ti, i7 9700 strugling for a stable 30-60 fps on min settings",1
the game crashes every 5 minutes after about 2 to 3 hours of gameplay,1
game has bigger Graphics issues than Cyberpunk. These Dumb compatibility Issues crashed the Game and i lost my 32 hours Progress. I dont know if i can get it back and if not i will uninstall this game and ask for a refund.,1
"Can't recommend the game in its present state on PC simply due to the poor PC optimization. It works well on some setups but then REALLY bad on others, on my rig it uses around 40-50% of my GPU and CPU most of the time and there is still stutters and strange FPS drops. Geforce RTX 308032 GB RAMAMD Ryzen 9 3900XOther than that it seems like a great game, but the poor optimization (or whatever causes these issues) brings it down.",1
"LOVE the game!!!! not the Bugs....I'm putting this on the shelf until patches come out. my experience is being ruined because of the Frame rate drops, laggy area loading, and right out deaths because entire parts of the map disappear while I'm walking on them. I understand that deadlines need to be met and its getting more difficult to keep up with technology(for the time being), but this kind of release acceptability is going to force me to start waiting to buy titles for at least a year. I don't like having my Experience diminished and immersion broken by game breaking bugs. By the way... still haven't bought Cyberpunk, lost my desire to 6 weeks after the game release due to the bugs. With that stated this is a really spectacular game. Hogwarts castle alone is amazing. the combat system is smooth and responsive. the quest system isn't boringly arbitrary, it forces a good amount of exploration and the puzzles are interesting.  I feel just like a student at Hogwarts(when i'm not falling through the floor). whenever a stability and bug patch comes out I will change my Review. One last thing, thanks for not gimping my key-bind preferences like Elden RIng and a lot of other console ports did with their half-assed half static half customizable key-bind crap. WASD is for people who like carpel tunnel syndrome and who also like get owned in tournaments.  screwing with my binds is a deal breaker that will earn you a ticket straight to refund land. Not just because i have trained muscle memory but because I have to save my wrist. And the fact that you are one of only 2 games that i bought in the last year that i didn't have to return immediately says a lot. Thank you!!!I do not regret buying the game when i did. but if you're an immersion junkie like i am i would suggest waiting. I bought it 1 week after release.",1
shit game,1
Hard difficulty is a complete joke. I paid $74 for the deluxe version and beat the game in under 24 hours of play time. I feel like the ending was rushed and there is no reason a story game of this caliber should be able to be completed in under 24 hours. Being able to have 25 health pots allows you to cheese through everything. Pretty disappointed with the game overall.,1
"TL;DR, this game is all style with little substance, though the style is indeed quite stylish.I want to start by saying that I was very excited for this game, that I am a big Harry Potter fan, and that I wanted to like this game.This game is a missed opportunity, especially on PC. It clearly was built for console gaming, and this is felt in many areas of the game: the frame rate stability, RTX implementation (specifically reflections), the menu design, the flight model, and combat balance. The last 3 of these issues are drastically solved when using a controller: the menu feels more intuitive, the flight model is like a sunny, smooth, and breezy day compared to the dark, clunky and awful night on keyboard and mouse, and finally combat has a measure of difficulty when using a controller whereas with the most basic of spells (enough to break the different shields) combat felt ridiculously easy with a keyboard and mouse. The first two are not so easily solvable with terrible PC stability and  awful reflections (mirrors are frosted glass, even with RTX). This alone would be excusable, but there are other elements that are bad and are compounded by these issues. It is important to note that you cannot fly freely. You cannot fly indoors nor through certain parts of the map.One of these elements is your character. You start as a 15 year old who cannot even cast the most basic of spells: lumos. If you ask anyone who knows anything about Harry Potter, they will tell you that lumos is a basic lighting spell that a first year learns very quickly. The fact that you do not know this spell at 15 is NOT a bad thing on its own. However, it needs to be taken into account when looking at character progression in the game. Since you start with less knowledge than even a first year (as they buy their books BEFORE they being their year at Hogwarts), it makes absolutely no sense that you are able to beat characters who have had 5 years of education at an accio game, a duel, and a broomstick time trial when you hadn't even touched a wand only a few months ago. By halfway through the year, you are expected to take on opponents that are able to abduct curse-breakers and are more competent at police work than the aurors and you SUCCEED at both. This is explained away by the conveniently unexplained ""ancient magic.""Ability and competence aside, EVERYONE absolutely LOVES your character, regardless of what you do or what you choose in the dialogue options. 2 people who have been friends for 5 years are having an argument. You speak to one of them without even knowing them, and they listen to you and value your input more than their friend's. You cast an unforgivable curse (like crucio or imperio) right in front of a professor? No problemo, it is ignored and you get praised. No matter what you do or say, or even if they know you or not, you will be the hero who solves everyone's problems.In summary, your character is a Mary Sue. (if you don't know what that is, please look it up)The story is another inexcusable part of this game. Simply, it is terrible. There is no nuance or no choice, and it is forgettable. Evil goblin wants to rule the world by stealing magic that only you (except for the goblins, apparently) can see and access and you need to stop it. Simple as that. Classes are a series of clips that require no interaction, have no bearing on story (aside from unlocking some spells) or character development. You do NOT feel like a student. Aside from 1 very poignant moment in a SIDE QUEST, and a single part of a main quest mission (not even the entire mission), there is nothing remarkable about this story. I think the fact that a moment in a side quest made me feel more than the entirety of the main story speaks volumes about this game.Another issue presents itself in the form of world interaction. I touched upon this briefly when I mentioned casting unforgivable curses and the complete lack of consequences for doing so. There are 0 consequences for anything that you do, except for a slight setback in your progress when your character runs out of hit points. You can break into offices and houses to steal loot and the occupants have no reaction. In the middle of winter, students are in Hogsmead with T-Shirts. In the middle of the night, students are still out in Hogsmead, and the shops are still open. Only enemies (mobs), quest-giving characters, and shop keepers even acknowledge your presence, and that is because they are required to for game mechanics.With no alternate endings, this constructs a world and a story that revolves around the main character, instead of building a world in which your character can affect with decisions that you make.As others have mentioned, the equipment system in this game is also ridiculous, from the frequency you obtain equipment, to the stats of these, all the way to how much equipment you can carry. The stats on these items are so meaningless that all you really need to do is pick the highest number. There is little synergy possible with different items, and what little there is only offers small combat benefits that you could easily do without. There are no items that grant special abilities nor trade-offs that you need to make when choosing which items you want to wear. There is a strong synergy between the amount of equipment you can carry and the frequency that you get equipment that, unfortunately, makes both worse. You get equipment so often, and you can carry so little equipment that you have to interrupt your gameplay in order to empty your inventory in the shops, unless you want to waste potential gold.This game does do some things right, however. The world that the artists designed looks fantastic. The art is amazing. Whomever was responsible for crafting an explorable Hogwarts and putting it into a videogame absolutely succeeded and deserves every single bit of recognition for their work. The same can be said about the world outside of Hogwarts, alongside the sound design. There is no denying the love and effort the artists put into bringing their vision of Hogwarts into the reality of their game. The music is memorable and quirky, the ambient sounds ARE immersive, the sounds of magic are, indeed, magical, and the voice lines are generally well done (though this depends on the voice actors).If the story and character progression and development were well executed, I would be willing to overlook the feeling that I get that this game was built and balanced from the ground up for console, but this is not the case. After two years of delays, this game completely under-delivers and makes me wonder why it was needed.if my arguments are not persuasive, I will include some Q & As from https://www.hogwartslegacy.com/en-us/faq and will give my take on whether it was accurate.Q: What kind of game is Hogwarts Legacy?A: Hogwarts Legacy is an immersive, open-world, action role-playing-game set in the 1800s wizarding world, which puts players at the centre of their own adventure. This game does not put players at the centre of their own adventure, it puts players at the centre of the main character's adventure, which is an important distinction.Q: What is the original story of Hogwarts Legacy?A: Players will experience life as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1800s as they embark on a dangerous journey to uncover a hidden truth of the wizarding world. They will grow their magical abilities by mastering spells, brewing potions, taming magical beasts and more. While the game includes mastering spells, brewing potions, and taming beasts, and little more, players will not really experience life as a student at Hogwarts, nor do they really uncover a hidden truth of the wizarding world.If you want a medium to explore Hogwarts, this is for you. If you want an opportunity to create your own story in the Wizarding World (which is what the game advertised), this is not the game for you.",1
Denuvo Remuvo,1
Was able to play for about 3 hours after release. Took a break came back and now I can't get past the downloading shaders screen. I've tried every possible fix offered online and nothing has worked. The patch they released did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to fix this and I still can't play days after release. Completely unacceptable from a company that has been working on a game for years,1
"Comment will come out later, but there is literally nothing which justifies the price nor the hype of the game - even as a Harry Potter fan it is underwhelming. Old PS2 games were by far better.",1
glitches too much,1
"If you're on above 1080p save your money. Same issues reported in beta 8 months ago.... verbatim same issues. I have 3080ti and even in cut scenes (you know non interactive movies) drops to 11fps. Friend with a 3090 and RTX off and 13h gen intel.... drops to 30. Now you know why there was no PC previews out there and the PS5 were everywhere. Also why they launched it days earlier is to get the good press in the algorythm before this. I bought this game for 2 reasons. First was to support the author, second was it was supposed to be a great game. Absolute trash experience. It's pretty, but it's nothing bleeding edge. OH more ram you have the more it eats. Mine sits at 15 GB on average JUST FOR THE GAME. CPU and GPU are not maxxed, but feel like I am trying to run a raid in WoW circa 2005/6. Experience is absolute trash",1
scooby dooby doo,1
"I have a Mid/lower end PC that can at least play any game I've come across, This game is truly the first to break that streak.The Stuttering and FPS drop is so bad its nearly unplayable at most times. At this point I can not recommend this to any PC gamer's.Don't get me wrong, This game (for the little I've managed to play) has been a wonderfully fun time. This game scratches all the nostalgia itch's and more, so much more. Don't buy this game right now, not for PC at least. I would get a refund just because I have vary little in the way of disposable income and can only get two or three triple A titles a year, Sadly I spent a lot if not most of my time with the game on in the background while I was looking for mods/guides to fix Unplayable stuttering and the worst FPS drops I've ever seen",1
laggy game with mad FPS drops. Fix your fucking game,1
"I would love to recommend this game, it's really fun, but I can't. On PC this game runs like complete trash, very rarely getting above 10 fps with lowest settings on a more than capable system. Either get the console version or hope to god they sort out the issues on PC.",1
"Had this game for 4 hours, over 2 hours of that were trying to actually get the game to run so less than 2 hours of actual game play.  Tried to get a refund but Steam were less than useless, no what's wrong with game? Is there anything we can do to help?.... Nothing... just a you're not getting a refund.  I am running a 12th Gen i7, 32Gb DDR5 RAM, NVIDIA GFeForce RTX 3080Ti, 32¡± Monitor running at 2560x1440 @165Hz.  With the game set to Medium setting it never gets above 35FPS.  So because of Steam I am stuck with a game I can¡¯t play or get my money back for.",1
"The game itself is pretty good, *when* I can play it. It plays perfectly fine until I have to use the menu for any reason, and you have to use it a lot. Every time I open and close it, the frames drop significantly and the game will crash if I try enter any new areas or fast travel. Would love to get some more time in.",1
"Terrible frame drops.   CPU utilisation vs GPU utilisation for GPU specific functions.Bad controls and menu selections.Enjoyable, but ultimately a collectathon with a single ending.",1
GOD DAMMIT !! PLEASE FIX THE GAME !!Having a lot of fps issues lately and it's really frustrating !!,1
"awful game, terrible optimisation, even on high specs game runs like dog water",1
"The game is in a bad state when a lot of people still are unable to even log into the game. i was able to log in straight away and play for like 5 hours, after i logged out and logged in the next day, ity wouldnt load past the shader load screen. so that sucks because it is a fun game thus far",1
"This game has 4 good things going for it:* Good Collector/Achiever game* Good open world exploration* Fine combat system* Cool room of requirementBut it has at least 7 bad things that the developers shouldn't have missed, it would have been easy to not destroy in the process:* Extremely linear story with no choices (it doesn't branch). Dreamfall Chapters etc is a billion times better story* Ongoing point system, so your character can make the difference in the House Cups (Please focus more on house cups, its the only thing i care about in harry potter games)* There should be at least 5 classes of every type, but there isn't* There should be duo campaign like in red alert 3, where you can sync and complete missions together (where the other character will act like side-companion)* There should be a year 6 and 7, also prefer to focus more about school aspect* There should be quidditch, please add it in a DLC, there is no reason for no quidditch, just stop focusing so much about open world and game world (3D), its more important to have the basics down than focusing so much on 3D graphics* Would prefer a less cringe ending...",1
Runs worse than Cyberpunk on launch.,1
"Not an actual RPG, game runs like shit even on a 30 series card, and the game being rated T for teen really kills the vibe.",1
"CONTRA:- Extremely, Ugly character creator that affects the whole experience (only/main reason for not recommending)- Old fashioned keybind system that affects whole experience; you have to wait until you unlock the whole keybind-system- Action combat with poor GUI with little information that affects whole experience, especially in Hard-mode... too much work to learn... too much reactive-mode...maybe there are builds to balance this, I haven't played much yet, after playing again and coming from Tab-target-MMO, combat feels so clunky, not trustworthy and clumsy... camera does not turn fast enough...you don't know what you are doing basically... just spamming left-click ... combat should much easier at start to entice...a bit more like Cyberpunk... you are the hero, not the one who gets spanked :) lol, oh, my... moving the character with WASD also is not reactive enough and shaky and does not back up combat... even in Story Mode, I have hard time to motivate myself to play the game, honestly...- Too much toxic positivity and positive conversations with cheerful NPC's in a world/videogame that is a lot about killing    breaking immersion... too much British positivity, which comes across immersion-breaking in a school where pupils get to learn how to kill etc..PRO:+ very beautiful, immersive environments (buildings in general), good lighting for my taste+ Some systems seem to be ok, I haven't played much yet+ Story is probably very nice too, I haven't played much yet+ You can be an evil villain, so I have heard and that is a main reason too why I purchased the gameI purchased it because I wanted a break from my MMO I have been playing and I wanted a game in non-scifi-world .

boring,1
"Dissapointing, Fun first 3hours or so then it becomes bland and unintresting.",1
"Stop giving exclusives to consoles. Playstation owners get access to the Haunted Hogsmeade quest, which includes access to an extra dungeon, the Shopkeeper's cosmetic set, and access to a special Hogsmeade shop in which you own. The Haunted Hogsmeade quest should've been a DLC. This is a big failure on Avalanche and Portkey. Because of this, I'm leaving a negative review. With this many players, they would've made way more money off of it as a DLC than with any contract as an exclusive - Especially since the Dark arts pack is listed at $20 USD. Imagine what they would've been able to charge for Haunted Hogsmeade with a questline, a shop, and cosmetics - $50 USD? Stop giving exclusives to consoles.",1
"Can't sex children :cI don't know what kind of lab research devs commited, but they chose the most unmotivated and unintresting companions in the whole scenario (except for Sebastian, he's the only one who has motivation to hold on to main character and somewhat intresting backstory). Even Cressida got more motivation to follow MC because we actually somewhat save her reputation by returning her diary to her. Also, I don't really get it why Adelaide won't become our companion even after we save her uncle because gratitude is one the strongest motives to help someone. Instead of at least those two, we get Ugadau girl who brags how her school is better than Hogwarts and how much better education there. Also I don't like her soppy attitude. Like... really. Each of her reappearance I feel like I'm forced to gulp on a few bags of sugar and wash it down with a few gallons of honey. Moreover she's the only NPC who does the most unforgiveable thing in the game possible - she suddenly stands still during the mission and starts to cry about her dead father without any reason to share such thing and you can't even skip it because it's not in the cutscene. She literally just stands still for 4-5 minutes talking to herself and won't let you proceed with the mission. Also I don't like the fact devs FORCE us to be her ""friend"". For example, in almost each dialogue with Sebastian we can hide any information, lie to him or straight up force him to take Crucio spell instead of us. With her... Well... Game kinda forces you to be honest with her even if you don't want to be her friend or roleplay as sneaky slitherin dark apprentice.Moving to the next one - Amir. This guy joined us as a companion because... Well... I dunno, he just did it. Really, why didn't you give him at least somewhat reason to stick to us? Or replace him with Cressida or Adelaide.Well, Poppy got somewhat of motivation - for some reason that weirdo thinks we are weird too and decides to stick to us. At least she's not annoying and help to express MC as a white knight when we stood up to those who bullied her.Finally, my verdict is - devman = badman >:c (not all of course, one who did Sebastian's story arc is a champion. Hope they get a raise)",1
"I have enjoyed the exploration, combat, and cat petting but I will say what seems  to be sorely lacking from reviews I've seen.The game is a buggy mess. I have encounter far more bugs than I did playing Cyberpunk. I have had multiple times where controls straight up stop working or the character says ""screw the player I'm doing my own thing!"" and starts acting like an idiot. There are several visual glitches and HDR and ray-tracing do not work at all, but they do effect your frames still. I keep phasing through objects and getting stuck in floors and the ground. Most characters have no facial emotions other than some weird twitching they do before returning to their default death stare.Whats worse.. the underlying game honestly is a pretty subpar game. Other than what was mentioned at the beginning, the story and character design is pretty bad.There is essentially no player customization. I loved the main series, but the story-line in this is pretty meh, every quest is ""wow, ancient magic!"" and all the side-quest are ""if only someone who just learned this spell could help me with this task!"" Your ""student experience"" involves primarily receiving letters telling you to do mind-melting task on your own. Its a shame because the game starts so strong with classmates and classes, then just quickly falls off completely.Oh, and J.K.Rowling still makes money off this.",1
"Lots of crashing. Using a steam deck, overheating processor. game needs some fine tuning",1
"This is a difficult review to compose for a number of reasons and I'm honestly torn between recommending it and not recommending it. If there was a neutral option I would go for that.I've played a good number of hours now, and I the longer I play the sadder I feel about playing more. Not in a good way either this is not a ""this story is moving me emotionally"" kind of sadness, but more of a ""this could have been so much more and it falls so tragically, dreadfully, woefully short"".I realize a lot of my reason for this are subjective but I will try and be and give as possible as possible information in my review. I'll also split up starting with the most objective criteria and move to the more personal experience near the end.First: The presentation:The game is pretty, the castle looks good, it's a joy to see the sights. Performance is mixed. Sometimes you can have 120FPS and then turn a corner and have it drop to 20. Optimization is rather poor, a potato will not run this (or give you nightmare fuel).The music feels suitable though is a bit bland and unmemorable. I dare anyone who has played it to hum any tune more ten minutes after closing the game.Controls are rather responsive but for combat it relies a bit too much on the multiple spell bars, which feels clunky for no reason.The hud elements are a bit too present, Honestly turning off the hud increases immersion immesurably, buuuut the game is designed in such a way as to rely on the hud elements, especially for combat and spells.I would like to discuss gameplay here but I will have to take a small detour into story first, you'll see why in a minute.StoryProbably the most subjective. A minor spoiler: this is a chosen one storyline, you have a power no one else has and consequently have to do missions no one else can. A lot of people will probably like this (going by review score). I am sick to death of them and I think it actively works to the detriment of the overall gameplay experience. I want to be a magic student, go to class, learn spells, learn to make potions, play quidditch (isn't in the game btw, just cancelled ""this year"") make friends and get into trouble in a way only magical teenagers can. But you can't you barely go to class other than your first day, interaction with other student are only for self contained sidequests where you are the local problem solver/fetch quester or in service of them main story and then only sometimes. I usually groan when the main quest comes up because it takes me away from the experience I am there for. It doesn't help that very very early into the story you are expected to kill people, this is treated as no big deal.GameplayThis story emphasis on the chosen one questline becomes apparent as mechanics are introduced and then never used again. Care for plants and making potions are great examples. You are told how to care for a specific type of magical cabbage, which then enver comes up again? Want to grow a plant, any plant? Just put it in a pot and wait... That's it. Same for potionbrewing: In the first class, you have to put ingredients in the cauldron, stir the right way, and decant. ever comes up again. Want to make a potion, just go to a potion stand, click a button and wait a number of minutes. Why can't you just get a textbook and have to scroll to the correct page to make a certain poition and then run through the steps? When you learn a spell the first time, youa re in class, the spell is explained you follow a figure (while your character just makes circles with their wand for some reason), then you get to test that spell in class and there's even a sort of mini-competition to learn to master the spell. This was fairly amazing, it was inventive, interesting and fun. It never comes up ever again. Virtually very other spell is a matter of ""do some challnges on your own, show up for class, watch a little cutscene of people being in class, learn spell"" (in the best case, often there not even that). The forcus is also on gathering collectibles to level up in general, and for learning spells in particular)Overall the gameplay experience feels shallow at best and lazy at worst. But the thing that irks me most is just how close the game way to brilliance. You can see moments where it seems to know exactly what to bring into the experience to make it memorable. It is painful to see and feel that the building blocks are all there, but it falls so painfully short. And I end up feeling sad, partially for the game itself, but mostly because of its reception. This game is being praised into high heavens and it just doesn't deserve it. It's not a bad experience by any stretch, just a mediocre one. And because of this praise we will not get a better one for the next decade as there is no incentive to improve. If a new Hogwarts game comes, it will be like this: another open world with lots of little repetitive and vacuous side activities, another chosen one ""world at stake"" plotline and shallow gameplay elements. Verdict: get this in sale for ¢æ20ish when you have 50ish hours to kill and would like to explore hogwarts.PS. You know what could have really elevated this game, the nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor (which has been patented by WB games). But rather than use it for enemies us it for fellow students and activities. Have student A need help in charms class, if you help them they become closer to you and are more likely to help you if you fuck up in another class or can ask to bring them on another activity.Encounter Student B bullying student C. If you step in Student C becomes friendly and student B becomes a rival (or vice versa). How they did not figure this out themselves is beyond me.",1
"The interest of this game comes down to the lore of Harry Potter. However, for such a price, there is very little content. An abyss of superficiality in png conversations. A taste of the artificial because of the desperate use of psychological incentives. Example: ""You're amazing. I feel like I'm grateful to you for going to retrieve that astrolabe from the lake. You're a good guy."" Welcome to seemingly benevolent communication. Sensible to make you appreciate the game by complimenting you. As far back as I can remember, it's the quality of a game that makes me feel good, not the gimmicks.Then there is also this ""all inclusive"" aspect, without depth, a bit like a checklist. Ok such nationality > check. Always with superficiality. Let's take the example of the professor of Japanese origin, who brings her back to the ""Tengus"" team - as if being Japanese boiled down to releasing a mythical animal like a collector's card (for those who don't know, the tengu is humanoid demon with raven wings). But then, why is she at Hogwarts, if not this list to fill?Making lists of appearances on the merit of ""representation"" is ultimately to point out the difference instead of recognizing a single humanity.A charming game thanks to its lore, but well below the adaptation of the witcher.",1
Terrible performance  and robotic acting. I shouldn't have to try 20 fixes to fix a $60 game made by a company that has the resources to fix the problem before release.,1
i give this game a 9 fps out of a rtx3080/r9 5900x/32gb@3600Mhz.,1
When compared to other RPG titles that have been released in the last 10 years Hogwarts Legacy feels hollow. Choices made by your character have no impact on the story. choices made in conversation don't dictate future interaction with NPCs or the way the player character is viewed in the world.,1
"crashing all the time, cant even enter the game",1
"So far, the game is poorly optimized for PC,",1
62 Minutes until you're allowed to save for the first time. So get used to hearing a language you didn't select. Also they added a profanity filter to your name. Is anything in this game online which would justify a stupid decision like this?,1
"The game isn't horrible but for a world driven RPG (like skyrim or fallout), the world feels very boring. I'll probably still finish it but would not recommend the game at this point.",1
"Completely unplayable. Never gets above 30 fps, constantly dips for multiple seconds at a time to less than 10 fps, textures often don't load, can't even go into a different room without having to sit there and wait for it to load. Tried all sorts of different settings, most of the play time was me trying to fix the stutters. Ultra, Medium, whatever settings I use it's the same story.",1
"My opinion of this game is it is decent.  It is not amazing and leaves a lot to be desired but it is subjectively fun.  The combat is neat and feels satisfying to fight several enemies.  In other words, your character feels powerful.  Exploring the Hogwarts castle, grounds, and surrounding areas is by far the best part.  Being able to explore a movie set come-to-life is a surreal experience.However, this game lacks a unique character/identity.  Aside from exploration and combat, this game is just like any other RPG you can think of (Assassin's Creed, The Witcher, Shadow of Mordor, etc.) just re-skinned for the Harry Potter franchise.  Reusing a tried and true RPG model of quests, exploration, and combat is perfectly fine.  However, the game needs a compelling story if it is to be a true masterpiece.  The story of this game is mediocre at best.  For as powerful as your in-game character feels, the stakes of the story just are not high enough.  The general storyline feels trivial and a lot of the quests seem pointless.  The root of this problem is the main character (the player character) has no backstory or motivations.  The character's motivations are the player's motivations.  This leads to a story where the player makes seemingly meaningless choices because they do not know what the character cares about.  Not to mention, the main story is exceedingly short and can easily be completed in 15-20 hours (if that).  For an $80 game, I expect more.Take any great story, AC Odyssey for instance.  The main character (whichever you choose) has strong family ties and is given a compelling backstory to make his/her actions in the game seem motivated by some other purpose.  Or The Witcher for that matter; Geralt's actions matter to the player and makes the player choose wisely causing the player to be immersed in the story.  With Hogwarts Legacy, none of your choices seem to matter and each potential choice results in the same milquetoast narrative development.  After 15 hours of gameplay, I found myself not really caring to progress the story anymore because it is downright boring.My other big qualm with this game is the art style and graphics.  The art and graphics feel dated at best.  There is no depth to the characters in cutscenes and all of the character models look far to soft and featureless.  They feel like expressionless bots that just exist to fulfill a narrative ark.  The graphics in general need a lot of work and optimization.  For being a 2023 game, it looks and plays like the Witcher III with Shadow of War-style combat.In short, I really wanted to love this game.  Hogwarts Legacy is fun if you enjoy seeing a piece of the wizarding world come to life in a very cookie-cutter RPG format.  However, its boring narrative and lack-luster graphics make the game seem altogether dull and uninspiring.  A better story and much better graphics would make this game look and feel much more immersive.",1
Extremely repetitive and boring,1
"I have to say, its the first time i envy PS5 players. Seems like its the new norma to publish unfinished and unpolished games for PC. Stutters all the way, Hogwarts Main Hall and Hogsmeade is your worst nightmare. Even with  DLSS on performance, you will notice how much work they did not put in porting the game from the PS5 to the PC. Currently i am running the game with a mod i saw online, and things are going way better (about 20-25% better performance) and keep in mind this mod was made by one individual 3 days after the release of a AAA game. I hope of a fix in the next month or so.Except the cons i mentioned, you will consume a lot of hours in this game, you will get to feel more and more confy and i guess its a great experience if you avoid focusing on the technical issues.",1
"Great mechanics. Fine graphics. Weak plot and character design.The 60/70 yr old professor in tutorial talks like a toddler and an altruist saint at the same time. The information density in the dialogues is way too low. It'd work for the original target age group of the HP books, but I'm sure the fan base is mostly over 20 now. Refunded.",1
"its okay.massive stuttering issues, and you cant play it fully offline.",1
"I would recommend to buy this game only if it's sometime on sale, becase it's pretty much 50/50 for recommend/dont recommend. Here's why:I'll start with optimalization, the FPS drops are sometimes terrible when entering other location, especially on low-end setups.The open world is amazing, so many places to visit. The combat system is also great, if I dont account for the unlocking of more spell ''wheels''. The clothing also looks pretty cool, but the clothing items often clip through each other, creating a horryfing immersion.The story can get boring at times, but I've enjoyed it.Probably the worst part of the game is the fact that you are supposed to be a student at Hogwarts, yet the immersion doesn't feel like it. You can wander around in the Forbidden forest or at night and not worry about being catched or anything. That's where it sucks. The house selection only matter for ONE single quest and does not affect the gameplay at all - not to mention you cannot be a ''bad guy''. The wand selection also doesn't matter AT ALL. Next thing, there's not a lot to creating potions, I was looking forward to trying out all the combinations of the ingredients and finding out different potions, well... You only have a few potions that you can use, and always have to create them one by one, waiting for one potion to finish brewing in order to be able to create another one. The last - is the thing that as soon as I've completed the ''main'' main part of the game, I had to grind for approx. 7 hours in order to get to the last main quest. It was pretty boring.",1
"Game looks amazing.The issue i have with it is that it's not optimised for the NVIDIA Ray Tracing options on PC.Turning RTX on will make the game look good but run like it's about to die any second (with the most insane stutters and fps drops i have ever seen), and turning it off will double the frame rates of the game at the cost of no RTX.Why is there even an option to turn it on if it doesn't work properly....and why doesn't it work properly?And why do i have to do detective work online and in the settings of the game, just to realise these things? I wanted to play a game, not learn how to optimise video games.It's frustrating that i spend almost as much time F$^*#$ with settings, instead of playing and enjoying the game and it took quite some time to realise why the game was performing so poorly, because of the RTX thing.It kind of killed the fun for me...Feels like an unfortunate situation for what could have been a great experience otherwise.",1
i love the game but it randomly deletes save files and stutters during cut scenes no mater the setting so i would recomend waiting until these issues are fixed,1
"the only good thing about this empty husk of a game is the map and environment. the story, characters and just about every other aspect of this game is utter garbage. the Playstation 2 harry potter game had more soul and character than whatever this watered down diarrhea is.",1

"I completed the game, it sure could use secrets.. I reckon my 2 year old self, could solve this sht.",1
"Seems like a fun concept, but it straight up does not run well on good hardware (RTX 3070 / Ryzen 7 5800X/ 16 GB RAM), even with all the RTX settings off.  I do not support 30 fps as a standard for gaming, and I do not support unoptimized releases. As such I recommend waiting until it is more optimized.Also, you can find it for cheaper on gg.deals.Will update review upon improvement",1
Game refuses to launch i tried every possible way my pc SHOULD be able to handle it on ultra just this game some stupid reason will not launch Uninstalled now game is completely done wasting my time i was hoping to ACTUALLY play the game. If for what ever reason will not launch when will allow games that require A LOT Higher system requirementsEDIT: after patch today 2/14/2023 finished first cut then crash again...... such a great buggy game 1/10,1
"The game seems fun but the performance is actually horrible. The game clearly needed another month or two before releasing on PC. I have an RTX 3080 and a 1440p monitor. With DLSS I should have zero technical difficulties with this game. Unfortunately that's not the case. Even with most settings at high and some at medium I get massive frame rate dips, stuttering every time I enter a new room, flickering and cut scenes that sometimes drop to 5fps. The game is a buggy mess at the moment and I honestly feel ripped off. Hopefully they'll fix it sooner than later.",1
"As it stands I'm not sure how to feel. Was able to play with no issues on Sunday 2/12 then the next day the game stopped working. There is a huge bug report on WB website (active since Feb 7th) with no resolution. Since I played more than 4 hours, my only hope is that a new patch will allow the game to play.",1
Very boring game fall in sleep when playing.Grafisch is not that fantastic. Dlc you get after playing the main quest for a time so then you get it with a quest.Not wat i have in mind . I pay for it so then give it at the beginning. And why not have a case or somethig where your clothing go when you have to much. To many bugs. Fall through the floor etc. So overal nice game but i not recommend it for this price and dlc's,1
"This game is fantastic. It shows a great deal of work and attention to detail. I have nothing negative to say about it.HOWEVER, the review stays negative until I can bind and use more than 4 spells at a time.",1
"Game is really good as a harry potter fan but I cannot manage more than 30 fps, with 3060 and 5800H. I tried bunch of fix but no chance. Game is using only %20 of my gpu and cpu. Devs please release a hotfix or something.",1
"Game runs like shit on a GOOD computer, one that can run Hitman 3 perfectly as well as Dead Space Remake.It IS in fact the fault of the developers and NOT your computer. Terrible PC port, don't get it.",1
"Great game, great visuals. Feels like all needed HP lore.But, please, fix the stuttering!",1
There's no excuse for adding Denuvo to the game. It doesn't matter if the product is good otherwise. Adding Denuvo is lack of any respect to the buyers and the gamers,1

I have a pretty beefy PC. the loading times and the PAIN i feel each time the game randomly freezes just makes me want to scream. how you cant use more than 4 spells at a time. the glitches that happen will make you laugh your ass off. But Would I really want to recommend this to other people. yeah possibly not. Its Dull to me. and constant loading times all add up.,1
when i started the game i had to start over (I was level 14 a few hours of play) I don't know how to fix it but I'm not going to play this game.Excellent graphicseverything is as it should be,1
"game breaking bug softlocked my game after 10 hours of gameplay, all saves corrupted, sad times",1
The game is really good but it has lots of performance issues and for some reason lags discord and I can barely stream it there. Will change review to a good one once the issues are addressed and its fixed.,1
"I know JK Rowling had nothing to do with this and the makers openly went against her transphobia but still fuck her. This game is slow as hell even if the combat has potential, most of it is a school simulator with fan service and stupid puzzles that are just annoying",1
"Nice atmoshphere, nice world, nice character design and integration of main quests. What isnt nice is that a LOT of the key parts needed for exploration are locked far into the main questline. Meaning you either explore the world last, or explore it first/midgame and then need to backtrack everywhere. So uneccessary.",1
I got bored of this game after the 10th time I got to do the same puzzle,1
"Performance issues across the board on 5600X and 3060 ti, tried swapping out for 3080ti and still performance issues. Suprised no one else is talking about that? 3FPS in a cutscene is pathetic and seems to only happen during cutscenes",1
"honestly for the first 15 hours or so I was pleasantly surprised - the combat was solid, exploration was fun & it felt that hogwarts & it's surrounding areas were faithfully recreated.sadly after the initial wanderlust wore off the world revealed itself to be barren, empty and simply filled with mundane bandit camps + collectables that lacked any real content. overall it's better than I expected but I can't bring myself to finish it.",1
"Hogwarts Legacy is more an interactive lightnovel, than a game. You're a character in an open map that's filled with fetch quests, mini-games and things to kill/collect.There's little to no player agency & the world doesn't really react to you, in fact, aside from cutscenes, mini-games and combat; you'll basically not exist to the outside world.You're barely in class and the classes you do take are cutscenes that you watch in order to deliver your fetch quests.Gear is inconsequential as are most RPG mechanics in the game.The story itself is alright, but nothing mindblowing. It's the standard: You're a special chosen one who can do special things no one else can. Great world, but I'd hesitate to call it a game. My recommendation is to only buy when discounted.",1
Stutter Legacy,1
No penalty for being evilNo conversations with random students besides miniquest plebsNo duel challenges with other studentsSide quests feels sameVery uncomfortable Menu some short animations are stupid like petting cat + Big world that's it,1
"As a Harry Potter fan: the game looks deep and rich at first but after a few hours it becomes obvious that it's extremely shallow. Everything is an illusion.The RPG elements barely exist - no meaningful relationships and no repercussions for negative player behaviour. Every character that you encounter feels more or less the same, there's very little soul to them. Classes have no depth to them, either just a short cutscene starts, or you learn a new spell and amaze everyone in the class in 30 seconds. Then you're out. No quidditch, plants and potions are pretty limited (less than 10 of both) The Room of Requirement feels like a chore with the low wait times, if you want to be efficient you basically have to go back every half an hour to check on things. The game runs horribly on PC - these graphics have no business making 30 series cards sweat one bit - yet they do, with constant fps drops and overall bad performance. Movement feels clunky, I dread every moment where I have to swim or do parkour. Getting around with the broom is frustrating too, if you don't have a huge grassland under your ass, you'll have trouble landing. Enemies are repetitive and shallow. Puzzles are kindergarten level with no thinking involved. The only time you can't solve a puzzle is because you haven't progressed far enough yet to get the required spell. The only positive things I can mention about this game is Hogwarts and Hogsmeade - they are made really well - although they are also the most stuttery parts of the game which takes away from the enjoyment. The combat feels good too, it doesn't surprise me that these 2 points were the main marketing materials, every other rough part of the game was hidden. Combat also suffers by the extremely broken mechanism that is stealth. After you unlock it you can just wander around camps and one shot everyone for the rest of the game without having to engage in real fights much. This is on the hardest difficulty too. This game had so much potential but at it's current state it's nothing more than cash grab bullcrap for mindless Harry Potter fans who'll defend it with tooth and nails. The game will hopefully get actually developed in the coming years, just like Cyberpunk and the new Warhammer. Looks like nowadays this is the standard for game developers: cash-in early with a game you can barely call early access, then take your sweet time adding all the missing things.I hate that the game is what it is, I wanted to love it so bad - but it crossed a line where I can't turn a blind eye. I will still 100% it and wait for future updates, but my dissapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I feel sorry for the people who's standards are met with the ability of being able to pet mutant looking cats.",1
Just boring...,1
"FIX YOUR PC PREFORMANCE ISSUES!THE WHOLE GAME IS STUTTERING CONSTANTLY ON 1070!   when i started playing the game it was'nt doing that. The longer i play the more problems!You probably made more than 500 million on this game! NOW FIX IT! The game is great otherwise in every way but no one can reccomend a game that hardly runs . Probably thanks to your denovu implementations. Fix it and i will change this review* they brought out an update out 14/02 , still runs like garbage. Dont buy",1
"Several days after the initial release, the game continues to be buggy. The frame rate skips, frequently, and freezes. For a game that is less graphically endowed than The Witcher 3, My PC should not have trouble running this game, but it did. I have played better looking games with no problems, but this game is a train wreck. I Was really looking forward to playing this but I had to get a refund because it's unplayable. I'll purchase Dead Space or something else. Until they fix the issues, I refuse to buy this game again.",1
"after 8 hours saving game no longer works, all progress lost. cannot play",1
"I wanted this game and played it for many hours when I first had it, and had no problems. Suddenly the game stopped starting up for me. Right before the starting video plays, it stops after the warning screen and goes back to windows. I'm reinstalling it now to see if my game code suddenly changed and had bugs where there were no bugs before. One thing I noticed is my hard drive is full, and I had to delete some games. Otherwise I will say the first part of the game seems thrilling.  I want to continue and hope to fix the problem.",1
"At first glance this game reminded me of Fable, which I quickly realized it was not.The game is just another low effort linear story driven open world game just like cyberpunk, lack of details in mechanics no interaction with NPC or students.When i noticed Students popping out and in around me it reminded me of cyberpunk, even the Great Hall despawn and spawn food right in your face, magic huh... Well at least they could fake in the food with an actual teleportation spell but they didn't.There's clearly laziness involved when it comes to game mechanics, devs just don't care anymore these days, gaming industry in a nutshell.Lost interest because the world feels meaningless empty and fake. When i play RPG games i want deep immersive believable world where i make my own story.If i want a movie i watch Netflix.If you like story driven game play and are in love with harry potter universe i do recommend it.but if you are like me who wants quality RPG, this is not it.And with the controversy over this game i don't take any sides.i just want to enjoy games in pease.",1

I have a GPU: 3080 rtx CPU: i9-10900K and 32G ram the game runs at 20 fps in 1920x1080 low settings i bought the game cause got good review and i dont even like Harry Potter this ppl instead of worry that Autor of the books like to suck dick instead of this poor performance. Elden Ring got same problem at release but after 4 day they patch the game this game is out for almost a week i learn that there is no difrence in between gamers and Biggots!!!!,1
"Please let me disable the hand holding or at least keep it locked to the ""storymode difficulty"" It's so annoying finding a puzzle to just have the player say ""maybe i should use fire"" after 1 minute.Left a bad review so ppl will more likely read this, spread awareness or whatever.",1

"I was so down to play this game but my pc can't even run it when I believe it should. If your pc is any weaker than a 2060rtx, rizen7 5800x 16gb ram maybe I need to upgrade to 32gb ram but I don't think that you absolutely need that much ram to game? Anyways, game's unplayable for me until they further optimize the game.",1
"the game is good but with the lowest graphics and removing half of my games to try and make this game runable, i am still unable to play this game without it being frozen mid battles or start crashing down. pretty much it feels like you need to have a really good gaming pc or a high graphic card and memory card to be able to play this with a pc or laptop. im a student and pretty much broke so im unable to get myself a good pc or laptop for this. would also be nice to be able to render the distance a bit smaller since it also lags my pc because of how much the game keep updating new chunks every minutes.",1
"So far I dont like itIm planning on playing more but the little visual bugs are just too much for me, there is just so many of them. Performance is shit on PC. The combat is junky and not really responsive. The game needs more polishing... Your characters voice doesnt sound real for some reason (It sounds really AI boosted). Idk what it is but i think it has something to do with the pitch of your voice. The npcs also dont really sound and look real (side characters) - the mouth movement is really laggy.So far i only had 2 game breaking glitch and that is a NPC being invisible.And a ball from Merlin challenge just flying off to the distance when it touched a wooden fence and not respawning (yes, there goes my 100% comp.) :) 4/10",1

Usually when entering a new area or after a cutscene ends.?BUT, aside from the optimization and bad graphic glitches, it's a good game; I especially enjoy the story and combat; the puzzles are well done in my opinion; and the missions are great for now and don't feel repetitive (side missions).?",1
"I am huge Harry Potter fan, finally I got open world wizarding game in Hogwart, but also I am a hardcore playerAfter the first 21 hours of playing my game crashed and I lost my saves, now after another 65 hours I am not able to complete the game 100% because the moth that is needed to complete the field guide page is gone (and when I played my first character the moth was where it should be) plus I'm really disappointed with the way things progress, you cannot learn things faster nor do activities like racing before the end of the story.But overall the idea is very good, despite the lack of freedom, I really enjoy playing this game, even after 85 hours of playing this game, I'm sure I'll be playing more, as far as I know, each house has a different story.Before they make any DLC, I hope they fix some of the important issues like moths, chess puzzles, chest that once oppend (when you have full inventory) sometimes cannot be re-opened.I hope that they add pause to cut scenes a Quick Save and Quick Load option, simply because in current state, manually saving and loading is a pain when you have to do before chests, Merlin puzzles, as you never know is it going to be broken or not.EDIT: After another 2,5 hours of playing, game crashed again, and yet again my character (saves) are missing!Game crashed while I was in Character editor, as I wanted to start again with different house and as soon as I pressed ""Start"" game crashed....I don't recommend this game until it's fixed",1

"A passable 4/10. Audio, Visual and gameplays are mostly fine but everything else are quite sub-par.Main character:Utter garbage. You have no personality and no role-play. You are designed to be a Harry Potter wannabe with brain damage. You are always cordial to other people and no choice to act in any other way. You have no conflict, you can see someone get killed, killing hundreds of goblins and do things that you have never did without displaying any emotion despite just being a normal civilian. Sometimes you laugh like... Oho! Aha! Instead of just laugh like a normal dude.Puzzles:Utter garbage. Its more of an eye-sight tests than problem solving. Story:Passable. Politics and diversities:Given the era we have a much more diverse casts than i have expected. But nothing interesting is done with their background. They are token characters that do not do anything special. The only thing they brought to the table are traditional clothings and accents - which feels out of place when you have more non-Caucasian professors than the caucasians. It would have been more effective if they focus on just one or two characters and build things up from there.",1

I Finished a few small Side Quests. Was around level 10.Starting the game again today I found that I lost ALL my saved Data. I have to create a New Wizard. What is this? Worst thing that has happen to me game related in a long time. Pretty Disappointing. 3 days of game play lost.Game is fun. Been a Potter fan for most of my life. As a Kid it was our bedtime story.

"First of all I DO NOT CARE about politics surrounding this game.That being said, the worldbuilding is on point.When it comes down to the rest the game itself is pretty bad.There is a huge amount of missing content.- No wizard¢¥s chess- No quidditch???!!! like wtf?- The world itself feels soulless as there are a lot of blank slates just standing about- Graphics are unoptimised as can be...we¢¥re talking late alpha optimisation here- Combat could allow for more combos and feels pretty restricitve overall- no black Lake??- The protagonist just feels bland....why not a named character that thinks for himself and has real struggles embedded in the story? I¢¥d be much more invested_NPC¢¥s feel boring and the dialoguie allthough voiced feels childish and is a chore to listen toand worst of all : -  No multiplayer nor coop??!! Hello?? it¢¥s a bloody school. What better game is there for multiplayer.To conclude, this game is okay......because it¢¥s the only one of its kind.Would there be any competition this would fall flat on its face and the devs know that which pisses me off beyond believe.It has A LOT of untapped potentialEdit : As a digital plattform asks me constantly to change my review:Once you get past the point where one unlocks the broom the game goes on a downward spiral...A bunch of lore errors.Conversations get even more bland and the lack of an actual character as a protagonist becomes clearer.Plus, the protagonist seems out of place...like not really a part of the world. Easy example for that is he does not have to turn in for the night to sleep. The protagonist is just ""there"" I noticed that the main menu and character select has an mmo touch to it which, along with other gameplay characteristics make me believe this was supposed to be an mmo at some point. When playing a single-player story game the protagonist and the world have to be convincing enough to get you immersed in the world and forget your surroundings from time to time.A good example for this is arthur and the world of red dead redemption 2.Sadly I haven¢¥t had that feeling in Hogwarts legacy. Not even for a minute. It¢¥s a bland yet beautiful world, where the protagonist, still a student that does not have toi abide a single school rule or custom, is the absolute superman and takes on armies of goblins and trolls over and over.Don¢¥t get me wrong, there is a story...but it¢¥s so superficial it very well couldn¢¥t be there at all.Again, if this had any competition it would take 2nd place but unfortunately it hasn¢¥t",1
"The game is great, a real amazing experience for any Potterverse fans, but if you haven't bought it yet wait until they patch the memory problems. This game runs great through proton (go linux gaming!) except it will crash at any loading screen if you have been in the game for more than 15 minutes, unless you edit a system parameter called max_memory_mapping (or something, i dont remember... look it up.) I did apply the fix and the game works well for about 4 hours then crashes my whole system (have to switch to a console and reboot,) I wish I would have waited for a patch. I had to reload the game (from a crash) like 15 times the first day I played (before the max_memory_mapping system adjustment.) This may or may not be a problem with Nvidia/Intel users, I am on an AMD system.",1
"Game-breaking bugs, unplayable.",1
"The game has been out for a week and the company keeps ignoring us. No day-one patch, no performance fixes is like they don't even care for the PC community.",1

lost 8 hours of gameplay,1
No Quidditch? No positive review.,1
game SUCKS i go to BED,1
"The game locks you out of content!!!!! Be careful with some quests that lock you out of playable content. The game gives you no heads up, and no indication you are making a choice. They can lock you out to up to 3 learnable spells. If you make the wrong dialogue choice, you are locked out of them FOREVER!!! WITH NO INDICATION OR WARNING!!!! If you want to be able to use that content, either you save in advance before those quests or you have to create a new character and play through 40 hours of repeated gameplay just so you can make the ""right choice"" and be able to use spells in a game that you paid 60+$. Very bad design philosophy. The game is all about collecting stuff, and locks you out some of that stuff, with no warning!!!! Hopefully they will patch that. Also, in a single player rpg with talents to unlock, again, in a game that is all about collecting stuff, locks you out (again) of some talents (by design). So again, if u want to experience certain upgrades on your talents, you have to create another character and play the 40+ hours required just so you can try an upgraded spell or some perk from the talent tree. There is no reason for these things to be like that unless they are trying to force the player to have to endure 120+ repeated hours doing the same thing just to he can finish a colectathon. Even assassins creed did that right.",1

"So this review might be different from what other people think but here it goes:This game is relatively good in terms of quality vs what I've seen in other AAA titles.They got Hogwarts right, exploring it was super fun.Gameplay is enjoyable, though repetitive after some time (combat, sidequests). The story is 'meh' (a wizard/witch transferring in the 5th year of Hogwarts? Ancient magic? Kinda reminds me of the type of non-canon stories that I see in Sword Art Online games that are mediocre at best).Lots of content, though some sidequests feel more like chores.Characters feel like they lack depth.Alohomora minigame (seriously? and then there's 3 levels to open different locks and to reach each level I have to look for collectibles that only appear at night?)Basically, after I played the game for a bit, and the rose-tinted glasses were off, I'd say I give it an 7 or 8 out 10. It is good, but I don't think it is a masterpiece.",1
"Phenomenal world design, directly drawn from the Harry Potter universe, but everything else falls completely flat. The characters are one-dimensional, without any additional complexity beyond ""good"" and ""evil,"" and the dialogue is ridiculously childish to the point of lunacy. The main character is your generic self-insert chosen one protagonist, which can be executed fairly well, but isn't in this case. Your status as a ""student"" is completely inconsistent with the gameplay and power fantasy plot, while there is almost no interaction with fellow students in a realistic way besides them simply praising you as this yet unbeknownst prodigy. Roleplaying elements are ""present,"" but they feel more haphazardly tacked on rather than actually adding anything of meaning (side quests are as generic as they can be, and dialogue choices offer no real choices or complexity). The gameplay is actually fairly well-executed, duels are fun and engaging, but certain fights certainly rely on sponginess, and the UI design is abhorrent (animations are impressively slow, while important gameplay elements are locked behind talents). Performance issues are present, but not unusably so, although it is comical for this to be an issue in a game with character models ripped straight out of 2015. Despite all this, it's definitely not a terrible game, with a very polished open world, beautiful art direction, and complete faithfulness to the Harry Potter lore, but it's by no means an especially great one, offering nothing new or special despite the illustrious Harry Potter skin. As far as licensed games go, this is a fantastic one, and Harry Potter fans will likely love it, but as far as games go in general, I'd find it difficult to recommend, even though I loved this series when I was younger.6.5/10",1
shit,1
performance is ass,1
"The Game is amazing, Beautiful graphics, everything is detailed the combat is incredible. But i logged on this morning to play and discovered that my almost 16 hour save file was gone, deleted. Does anyone have an idea why?",1
to much stuttering and i have a 3070ti  cant wait till its fixed,1
"[h1]I can obviously not recommend this game because of the main pocket the money is going to. Support the devs though ![/h1]The game feels nice, it looks good so far 3h in, it's a nostalgia trip since I've been growing with the HP series. I'll see if it lives up to its name and price.So far, I heard they used a pitcher on the ""male"" main character voice and if you want a slightly deeper or higher voice, it sounds horribly robotic and I can't get around it.",1
broom-handling is absolutely disgusting on keyboard+mouse :(,1
"Shallow and bland. Could have been amazing, there are things to enjoy but the story and characters are boring.Edit: I have to add that I wish there was a more nuanced option than recommend or not, there are lots of things that fans of the source material will enjoy, and one of the classmate's side quest is more interesting than the main plot. May contain small traces of pandering to people that seem to hate the writer of the source material.",1
"Difficult one to recommend. What small amount of time I have played I have enjoyed, but it's been painful. I have an RTX 2070 Super with all drivers etc up to date, and I have had lots of problems with slowdown, lag and freezing. The frame rate tanks into single figures at times. Graphic issues are also everywhere with pop ins and unloaded textures. I have tried every fix going at this time, and I had got the game into a somewhat playable state. But no more. There are people without issues it seems, but for the most of us, this game is badly un-optimised and needs more than a patch or two. Sadly I'm past the refund window, but I shall hold out and wait for official fixes as there is a lot of fun to be found here, just not today. Save your money and wait a while.",1
Game keeps freezing after agreeing to the terms of service.  Unplayable.,1
"game is unoptimzed for pc. I would wait until they release optimization patches before purchase.  as of 2/14, only pcs with more than 16 gb of ram can run the game without much issue.",1

Unacceptable stuttering even when game runs 100+ average FPS,1
"TLDR: The game runs very poorly on even high end gaming PCs and I recommend either getting it on sale or waiting until future updates fix some of the performance issues on PC. This is the same review I gave for Elden Ring on launch and it was later fixed, I hope the same is done for this game.****THERE WILL BE NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW, FOR THIS REASON I AM BEING INTENTIONALLY VAGUE****My PC Specs (Very relevant to the review:GeForce 3060 TI32GB of 3200 Mhz Corsair ramAMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6 Core unlocked (Air cooled)Hogwarts Legacy in many ways is absolutely an amazing game.I am about 30 hours in, probably 1/3rd of the way through the main story, and have spent a ton of hours roaming the countryside absolutely murderating dark wizards and aggressive fauna.The story is compelling and interesting, the cutscenes are spectacular and entertaining.The elephant in the room is the overall performance. The game runs like a hot turd, and I would consider my PC to be a fairly top end mid-range newer gaming PC.The game uses 4GB of RAM, 30% of my CPU while idling in the open world, and ""very high"" power usage in task manager.I have not had a single crash, it makes my PC very warm but no overheating.That all said, the game runs horribly badly under load.During cutscenes, my character often gets a bug where his voice sounds like a robot. Occasionally other NPCs sound this way too. Their voices almost echo just a bit and it makes voices sound tinny and electronic.Sometimes this doesn't happen and they sound fantastic.The game performance was actually quite nice until I got further into the game and combat started involving 6+ enemies at a time, multiple spell effects going off, many projectiles in the air.The game has a ""spidey-sense"" mechanic where incoming attacks are foretold and you either reflect (yellow sense) or dodge roll (unblockable red sense), which works great until you get a bunch of enemies on screen.The FPS then starts to tank dramatically and the indicators for these effects show up either right when you get hit, or not at all anymore, making combat dramatically more difficult.As well, the game features a very standard soulslike lock-on system, which strangely will just stop working all together when the game starts lagging. It makes the noise like my character has locked-on but then no reticle appears and my character refuses to stay locked-on to the same enemy. Again, artificially inflating the difficult of combat.Specifically, there are combat trials, essentially outdoor wave-based fight arenas, where you sometimes fight upwards of 10 enemies simultaneously, and all of your prior experience goes out the window as your target-lock and your spidey-sense go out the window of usability.The frame dip to a crawl, as you swing your camera frantically trying to kill enemies one at a time so you don't get overwhelmed and the game can try and stabilize, but at 3-5 FPS it becomes impossible (Again, my PC runs all modern games on very high or ultra just fine, at upwards of 150 fps)Another issue is that even on hard mode, enemies pose basically zero threat if you use your combat skills effectively (IE: Your frame rate doesn't tank and handicap you)I have defeated level 30+ boss enemies at around level 15 without getting hit, the game gives you a ton of leeway with dodging and blocking. (Until 7 enemies come on screen and then they become completely ineffective)Additionally, I have run into several other bugs.Loot and interactable objects spawning inside terrain, becoming unreachable.Jumping into spots that you cannot jump out of, especially in areas where you cannot use your broom, can softlock you and force a reload of an autosave.Mouths moving completely out of sync with NPC dialog.The onscreen button icon locations do not align with Nintendo Switch controllers used on the PC version, the game expects you to be using an Xbox controller.The combat feels a bit generic, there is a slight paper-rock-scissors style to enemies having different colored defensive bubbles and you have to use the corresponding type of spell to break their defense.But it just ends up feeling like Arkham Knights/ God of War button mashing generic combat pretty much the entire game.I actually highly recommend this game IF you are playing on console, or later down the road when they patch the PC version with some optimization fixes.I'd also recommend waiting until it is on sale.It is a single player game that doesn't seem to have much replayability.The game devotes a ton of resources towards a customizable housing area, you are also able to completely customize the appearance of your armor, your wizard, your wand, even your voice. Despite being a single player game and no one will ever see the way you decorated anything.",1
"I guess it is ok. I both love it and hate it as a HP fan. Probably would have recomended it if it didn't crash every 4-30 minutes now. The first ~9 hours were fine, but now it crashes a lot. It feels like it wants to do the world justice, which it does in a lot of cases. But it absolutely doesn't in others.As said by others you don't feel like a Hogwarts student at all. Lessons are very much on the sideline, and only done to get access to some spells and potions. The 'Forbidden Forest' is forbidden, but for some reason you can just go wander into it without any problems. You just have to deal with some spiders and poachers from time to time. The world is gorgeous and Hogwarts itself is massive and you can really get lost there (if you dont use the quest tracker).At the same time it, Hogwarts and to a lesser extend the rest of the world, feels very empty. Yes there are other students and Peeves is doing his usual business but you can barely interact with it. Most of the interaction is meaningless and does not recieve any reaction from others in the same room. You can blast a firespell into a group of students and nothing happens. This makes the game really feel 'on rails'. In the 'Forbidden Forest' you encounter a lot of creatures who do not react to your presence at all! Yesterday I strolled passed a group of Centaurs and they didn't seem to notice me at all. The stuff that is there is very polished and works very well. The combat is fun and engaging. But after a while the things that you cannot do start to bother you. For instance, you can't jump over the railing of a staircase, there are invisible walls everywhere. What year is this? Let me fall to my death by jumping over a railing if I want to. Or at least make the wall look like it is some magic barrier, as if it is a magic protection. Now it just feels lazy.The RPG aspects are a bit shallow (maybe I am spoiled by Skyrim). I don't feel like I have a lot of choice in how to build my character. The gear feels very generic, the talents don't feel like impactfull choices. Just pick the talents for the spells that you use because it straight up upgrades them. I wish the options for combat were more varried. Now it is basically just blast spells. I think a lot more could have been done with potions, herbology, conjuration, transfiguration etc.The more I am thinking about it the more flaws I start to see. I am starting to sound like a salty old man (probably not too far from the truth ;)). But it feels like a game with so much wasted potential! Would probably be a 6.5/10 for me if it wasn't for all the crashes.",1
It is a really fun game don't get me wrong if you like the Wizarding world and magic you have come to the right place although just for the fact that there is a PlayStation exclusive quest that is taken away from the other players I can't give it a thumbs up if it was just cosmetics by all means then it does not bother me but making a whole quest unaccessible for 1 year and we all payed the same price I am sorry that does not work for me I will be 100% complete with this game before the year ends,1
not a vary challenging game i found it boring,1
"I wish I could just review the game as mixed.The character creator is horrible. For all of the games pandering to a multi-racial Scotland that never existed it only successfully managed to make every Race look as mid-tier or ugly as possible. I found the games race pandering to be jarring and more unrealistic than Magic for an 1800's Scotland. The games cast is basically a Walmart in The Valley, California. And I say The Valley because having lived in Los Angeles I can tell you it¡¯s the most racially segregated place I have ever lived, right down to the streets people live on.If I made a game set in Zimbabwe and I made the cast paint by numbers diversity quotas I wonder how much criticism I would get given it¡¯s 99.6% African. Would diversity & inclusion be a problem then or would it be ok because its made for a ""modern audience?"" (And lets be clear made for a Modern Audience is just corporate speak for we are trying to pander to everyone in everything, thus creating nothing of substance for anyone.)In short this is more Lord of the Rangz pandering¡¦ Pandering to the people who boycotted this game & then went on to harass Twitch streamers for streaming it. Speaking of pandering to, them, the Bar Tenders voice is a joke. (I wonder if the Chinese track is a female voice?) The Male Witches and Female Wizards? You really won them over. LOL (I also wonder if that¡¯s an option in China?)Stepping away from the immersion breaking pandering to current year Games Journalist & the Rotten Tomatoes Crowd that loves Velma. The combat is very clunky with a controller & takes a great deal of time to get used to. I LOVED Dueling 4 on 1 on hard¡¦ that was SO much fun. (Not.)  I¡¯ve put over 20 hours into the game and I will finish it. The Story is interesting so far again aside from the immersion breaking Current Year nonsense.Dev¡¯s: Gut the character creator, install Black Desert Online and learn what a REAL character is. I don¡¯t care if people (of any race) want to self-insert themselves with a character creator but here's the deal they don¡¯t have to be ugly. I get it, its current year and only the Chinese & Koreans Game Studios are allowed to make games with pretty people in them but I¡¯m really sick of it. (Thank God for our Tencent Overlords I guess.) Also, re-record the bartender¡¯s lines with a female voice actress and patch the game before people do it with Open AI for you.As I said Mixed. A good game mixed with a bunch of woke nonsense to pander the audience that boycotted the game. LOL Word to the wise. If you're gonna make a game set in Western Europe before Tony Blair the cast should reflect our people and our culture or don't bother. People would not appreciate it if the shoe was on the other foot.",1

"The writing in this game is abysmal. I don't understand how potterheads can eat this garbage. Aren't you fans of the BOOKS!? Aren't you familiar with GOOD writing? I don't consider myself a potterhead, but HP is a huge part of my childhood. So yes, running around looking at things feels good, killing people is fun enough... but... and this is the classic example of ludonarrative dissonance. WE ARE KILLING HUMANS BY HUNDREDS AS A HOGWARTS STUDENT. Remember how some people might pick on other games (last of us) for inconsistencies between story and gameplay? This game is MADE OF THOSE. We all know how HP universe works and this game pretends to be realistic in that way. None of it really makes sense though. Characteristics of your wand - means nothing. Your teachers teach you random spells (like professor Snape... sorry, Sharp, teaches you depulso. Why? Same with others) and all the classes are 30 second montages of ""happy children learning"". We are also KILLING people for poaching???? We can use crucio (and other unforgiving curses) on people with NO CONSEQUENCES whatsoever. So... i guess those were the times, right!? A hundred years later someone like me would be called a dark lord. But here -  just a regular hogwarts student.  I can go on and on, this game is STUPID in all the wrong places and it takes you for a fool. Is it fun to play? At times, yeah, but honestly, i would prefer an HP game to be a visual novel with great writing and some real choices than this. Jesus.",1

"The performance and stability on PC is an absolute joke. For a AAA title to be such a mess on PC is beyond me. From startup crashes to memory leaks and terrible fps stability. If you have not bought this game yet I suggest you wait until they fix it (which doesn't seem to be a a priority as there has been zero communication about an upcoming patch), as it is essentially a coin toss whether you will have a stable and enjoyable gaming experience. For context these issues are not related to system requirements in any way shape or form, it is simply down to rushed deadlines and laziness.",1

The list is in order of magnitude of the problem.UPDATE as of 0558 2023-02-14 I now have to repair and redownload about 300Gb worth of files for the other Steam games I have installed. I have never had to do this after installing, ""playing"", then uninstalling a game.UPDATE #2 as of 1110 2023-02-16 I have had to reinstall Windows 10 due to problems caused by this game. When I lookedat reliability monitor the windows errors started minutes after my first in game crashes, so I it may be related. Also running the health checkup command it found multiple Windows OS files corrupted. I really want to like this game, but due to the issues Iwill be refunding it as I would rather use that money on something that doesn't break my PC.[list][*]Biggest problem is that when it crashes, it completely crashes Steam on my PC.    Even if I go into Task Manager and shut down all Steam related processes I am still unable to reopen Steam unless I     restart my PC.[*]Next problem is crashing upon launching the game or when it is trying to cache the shaders. It is so bad that the game    completely closes and doesn't appear in task manager at all yet it is still running even if I completely close Steam, and if    I am able to reopen it.[*]GPU drivers have started crashing while playing other games after installing this game. Games that it happened to    War Thunder, World of Warships(non Steam version), Cyberpunk 2077, as well as causing Chrome to crash and freeze while     using Youtube, and causing BlueStacks 5  to crash unexpectedly.

"Would only maybe recommend to HP fans.Think of the average open world game and smash the Harry Potter setting on it. That's Hogwarts Legacy. Combat is good, sound design is good, looks good.The game starts quite strong, but after 10 hours it gets dull very quickly. That's when I realized that the game just keeps on giving me yet another shallow and unfun chore to complete multiple times all over the world.The rest is very uninspired. Boring open world, tons of map markers, nothing truly exciting to find in the world.However there's a lot to do in the world, but it's just not fun for me. Uninspiring puzzles, dungeons that lead to only one chest with neglectible loot, etc.Also: Casting Revelio over and over and over again in Hogwarts is not fun",1

The need to stop sometimes the cutscene because of people getting into your room etc. is just super important. I don't want to lose any dialogue during the time somebody knocks into my door or I get an important call.",1
There was SO much dialog and next to no game play for 2+ hours. I almost didn't get out of the game in time to get a refund. I had to ALT F4. because you literally cant do  anything  90% of  the time. Keyboard and mouse is locked. The only way to exit is to Alt F4. or wait 20 minutes for a place you can actually save and leave the game safely. I had to start over twice because it didn't save. I don't have 1.5 hours to sit here and listen to dialog and not be able to leave the game at all. Or it wont save and you have to start from the beginning all over again. its all dialog and no game play. I understand telling us a story and getting us into the game. But you wasted 2 blasted hours on what? The dialog is lame. Your choices make ZERO difference in anything that I can tell. IMO this game blows. I don't see replay value at all. Which is fine for many of you. Enjoy. This thing is garbage.,1

"[h1]Recommended for the average H.P. fans, yes this game is recommended as it manages to tick all the boxes to delight any fan of the Wizarding world. For those who wanted more of the Wizarding world, and a more expansive original H.P. game then unfortunately this game did not deliver.[/h1]Starting off on the first point, I have say visually Hogwarts Castle was very fun to explore, finding its secrets and getting lost while searching for various collectibles. However once the magic was gone, I could not help but watch my disappointment grow ever more as the game did not pursue a normal school year as I was hoping for. Most of our activities take us outside of Hogwarts and little is spent inside the castle itself except for hunting down its secrets and collectibles, while our house is virtually non-existent. Only 1 student plays a bigger role in your house of choice, while others barely show up at all. We do nothing to help in earning house points, participate in house activities or even see our fellow fifth years in the dormitory room at all. The game has a shallow point in building friendship, but we barely ever do that except for only 3 students of which only consist of Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, and Slytherin. Ravenclaw is sidelined to side quests and a major story quest but does not even have an achievement at all like the 3 students which is poor planning.Hardly do we ever engage with our house or have any gameplay or story points that ties us to our house curriculum and we barely get to know any of our house students from 1st to 7th year. I wish this game had a companion system, which allowed us to build friends and be able to explore the world with said friends, from inside our chosen houses or making friends outside of houses, using their knowledge to gain access to more secrets or learning new spells but none of this ever happens at all.All of the time I am spent alone travelling around the world that feels empty because the magic is mostly visual, not gameplay aspects nor storytelling aspects. The only times that students do play a part, is only in a handful of major story quests and it feels more tacked in than genuinely feeling like I am exploring and tackling on the current threat to the world with friends I have discovered within the school.On that note, the magical experience of being a student in Hogwarts is sorely lacking. It feels too much of an generic open world RPG than an open world Wizarding World RPG because Hogwarts just does not play a bigger role than I expected. Choosing your house, doesn't matter because you don't do anything with your house. This game just steers the wheel conveniently pushing you from one plot point to the next without ever making sure that the whole school year is the focal point of your adventure. I wish there was more in this game that had to actually do with you being in Hogwarts, going through the school year and slowly uncovering the current threat, the fated adventure you have to take without being rushed into a generic Route A then to B style open world RPG that simply has the Wizarding World tacked into it.A final note, would be the Curfew in Hogwarts. There is none. Only 2 quests touch upon Curfew and it is promptly forgotten. There is stealth in the game, but it barely does anything except making it easier to clear an area. The game would have been more exciting if exploration during the night in Hogwarts you had to navigate around prefects, teachers and Peeves to collect the collectibles because night time in Hogwarts frankly was dull and boring with the occasional peeves just doing random things. Tied to the 1st point, this is another big disappointment. The classes are simply there visually but we barely take any classes at all except for the times when we need to learn a new spell. Even then, the classes do nothing but push us to completing a quest where a teacher just teaches us a spell then disappears until they are relevant again, if ever.It is perhaps the biggest flaw of this game, as much of the collectible system, combat mechanics and the exploration aspects should have been tied to the classes you take and sidequests could have been tailored to the Extra-curricular classes you can take. Even major story plot points should have been handled through classes, instead of you running off to the wild blasting things left and right without a care just to push Plot A to Plot B.An example would be the Astronomy class, which only plays a small role in you running around the wild finding Astronomy tables to collect Astronomy signs that don't even have a collection tab for them and only exist for the sake of padding the game. The only other thing it does is to introduce a character that plays a role in a story quest and nothing more. Astronomy and Divination could have been tied to talents, allowing us to unlock talents based on the celestial signs we uncovered, learning more about them through classes and forging our own talents as we travel through the story. Defense against the Dark Arts should have played a MAJOR ROLE as we spend most of our time blasting things left and right. Magical History also should have played a MAJOR ROLE in the main story, helping us discover the past more, learning hidden story points that could have helped us take an alternate route through the story.Even then, I wish Magical History was able to do more, as the Cairn Dungeons we find for gear are just randomly found walking around or zooming around. Instead of this, Magical History should have been tied to this system, in that advancing this class would have allowed us to learn more about the random caves and Catacombs we end up stumbling into as well as research and uncover new hidden areas that were lost in the past. Charms and Transfiguration could have been useful to expand the volume of spells we have to use in solving puzzles in the game as most of the puzzles only revolve around Accio and Flippendo with the occasional good-old blasting objects out of the way.Charms and Transfiguration could have also played a major role in expanding the inventory, instead of us having to complete useless Merlin Trials.Potions play a woeful role, as the teacher should have been more ingrained in the story itself. [b]The bigger travesty is that we have access to only 4 potions, which are not learned through the teacher but through a damn scroll we have to buy in HOGSMEADE.[/b] We don't even have to study the ingredients for it, we don't even have to study the damn potion itself because we can magically make it instantly without having any nuances to it. Hell they make you go through the steps with Wiggenweld but they don't make you work for the other potions which doesn't have a gratifying feel to it, when you are just looking at a timer ticking down on when it will be finished. With only 4 potions in the game, it feels as though the potion mechanics were an afterthought and not properly implemented to the game. Herbology is the same as Potions, with only 3 plants being combat items. Again, same point with Potions.Flying Class is pretty much a dead class, with the class only useful in being a tutorial on how to use a broom ingame. The rest of the broom mechanics is done through a student in time trials and an quest from a shop to upgrade the speed of your broom. You don't ever get to learn any advanced mechanics or be able to do cool stunts on a broom and instead just acts an alternate method of transportation. Again, like the rest of the classes, there should have been more effort to fine tune this area.Care of Magical Creatures is tied to Room of Requirements, which honestly was handled wrong. We should have progressed through the classes, learning new magical creatures and discovering their habitats through the classes instead of being able to just randomly go out find the beasts to ""Save"" instead of a house-elf hand holding us.",1
"Very bad optimazation... Unplayable, keeps crahing because its using too much ram.",1
"As Harry Potter fan - this game is good, great atmosphere, gameplay (mostly main quest and side stories) is quite funAs a guy who played a lot games before - it's just a grind game and it fully built on existing games like Assissin's Creed, Dying light 2 etc. Have  feeling that wotry was inspired by The Deathly Hallows book, whole scenes may be just copypaste from books, Out hero is Mary Sue who learns 5-year course in a few month, helps everyone, can use Unforgivable curses in front of good students/teachers and no one will say that you are monster. Don't forget about a lot of grind in the game - there are so freaking big amount of different collectibles in this game, but the only rewards for finding them - costumes (some are good, but mostly I don;t like them) and a little amount of XP. Also one thing pissed me off - it was game from fans to fans, but a few times in the game for me (twice as gameplay and once in cutscene) there was one moment when I was like ""WTF, why is this happeing with their wands"" [spoiler] When you cross the beams from wands like Voldemort and Potter few times in movies but there was a reason explained why is this happening. In the game it's happeing in gameplay because he's one of main villians, you must overcome it by quickly clicking on B button at some reason, even if you throw Avada Kedavra in his face[/spoiler]My feelings are mixed after finishing this game, but I see 95% positive reviews so I wanted to balance this a little so that's why this review is negative.P.S. Forgot to mention, spam casting Revelio sucks",1
"I would love to leave a awsome review, but like many players looking for answers the game continues to crash at the load screen of the game even with my pc specs being well over the recommended specs. Maybe one day there will be a patch but until then this game is a paper weight for a chunk of the community till fixes are made.  Guess i was meant to be a muggle.",1
"RTX 3080 12gbRyzen 3600xM2 SSD32GBRay Tracing OffDLSS onTerrible PC optimization. The intro ran incredibly smooth and got me totally hyped, once I got to hogwarts however that all changed. Terrible and constant stuttering, weird misty and blurry texture over every thing. I turned every thing down to minimum settings, including resolution and stuttering still persisted. Will change review once they patch this, for me its currently unplayable.*Update* 2/17/23: Same problems as mentioned above still persist, no visible improvement from last 2 patches.",1
"I really wanted to thumb this game up but I just can't. The first 10 or 15 hours are good while you are still in that honeymoon phase, however the game starts to wear thin very quickly when you start to see that nothing is fleshed out and nothing really matters.[*] Character interactions feel very wooden and barely make any difference at all[*] The game was sold on being able to be as good or dark as you want, this is just not flat out not true.[*] The quests mostly feel like MMO fetch quests[*] The game feels very lonely, there are lots of people around but you cannot do anything with any of them if they're not quest related[*] Nothing feels fleshed out, side activities, side locations are all very barebones. The only places that got any level of love were Hogwarts and Hogsmeade.[*] The story itself is very shallow and easy to predict and full of glaring plot holes[*] Combat is good for a start but eventually just feels like any other decent third person shooter.All in all this is a very good first attempt at a AAA game by this studio but the development creep is very evident and I feel like Avalanche bit off more than they could chew.",1
"Cannot recommend this game as it is now. Anytime i'm close to getting immersed and having fun, I'm reminded this is one of the worst PC ports ever released. And yet it somehow has a VERY POSITIVE rating here on steam, few reviews even mention performance issues, even though every other topic in the forum is about that.Avalanche doesnt care about the PC version, Deluxe owners got it a day later than the consoles, only to discover a horrible stuttering mess. PS5 is also the version all journalists got for review and it's the only version they ever showed during press, as well as getting exclusive DLC.On PC you can go from 80+ fps down to 40s and 30s for absolutely no reason, no matter what placebo ini tweaks you make, and changing graphics settings or resolution does not solve it either. I spent the first 10 or so hours of my playtime trying to get the game to run properly to no avail, AND making a character I was actually happy with (as the character creator is almost nonexistent). No patch or any communication from devs has been released. This is unacceptable for such a big (and now well-reviewed) release.",1
it's a scam,1
"Decent exploration, however the direction that this game takes is disappointing. You don't really play as a student, you are a teenager but you already can fight like geralt in witcher, so the gameplay is mostly going out for missions rather than trying to immerse you as a student and grow your power in hogwarts, you cannot cause chaos nor kill other students, there is very little interactivity at hogwarts. I cannot recommend this game due to the poor direction this game takes, there is just nothing special when it is just another action game, RPG part is close to non existant. Wait for sale. 6.9/10.",1
"Dont recommend the game in its current state, it either crashes or has major stuttering/fps drop issues.i would wait a few weeks or even months before buying this game, when it works tho it is really fun",1
borderline unplayable in its current state sadly.will remain negative until game is patched.,1
Wide and [b]shallow[/b]. [list][*] can't alter storyline[*] need to pop balloons around to learn some irrelevant spell[*] even stealth mechanics are numb[*] no NPCs give a fuck even if you cast unforgivable curses inside the hogwarts castle[*] no NPCs react to explosions and other stuff[*] interaction with environment is really limited[*] i played for 16 hours and 8 hours spent on waiting for menu animations[*] i can't scroll through enemies while locked[*] optimization is not existent (i play on 2060 with i7 10th gen and my computer crawls)[*] everything feels like a huge demo world specifically designed for leeching HP fans[/list],1
"It's great but the performance is absolutely atrocious. Dropping from 80 to 30 fps constantly, and then sometimes all the way down to 10-15 fps in some areas. It's super inconsistent. I can't recommend the game in its current state.",1
"About the much anticipated Hogwarts Legacy, after 45H of gameplay.I was expecting a much more groundbreaking game in multiple perspectives. Storytelling, graphical-wise and gameplay-wise. At first I was really engaged with the world of Hogwarts and it's quests, for about 10 hours before the repetitiveness kicked in. The game feels almost as a chore at some point (this point will kick in at different times for different gamers, but I can assure you that it will kick in). For completionists this game is mediocre due to it's repetitiveness and has, imo, little replayability. The collectible system feels very Assassin's Creed like.Some dialogue pretty much just annoys me, for example spouting the same three lines again and again upon leaving or entering Hogsmead. The world setting is great the inhabitants much less, people won't notice you entering or breaking in to their houses. No interaction with the most ghosts available, not even Peeves which is weird to me. It all feels a bit stiff. And in all honesty, the good-bad alignment is bad, very bad if compared to the likes of Fable.If I had to describe Hogwarts Legacy in a nutshell it would be; Assassin's Creed meets Fable with some J.K. Rowling sprinkles on top of it. It feels dated and forced, and it's repetitiveness feels like a chore. 6/10",1
"Few hours into the game you just relize that the game has very little to do with HP and its a just another RPG game with a bad story, characters with no soul, repatative quests and side quests and kinder garden puzzles. The overall expirience once you progress into the game is just boring.The only good thing about this game is the Art work which is just stunning",1
"Let me preface this by saying I'm in no way a Harry Potter fan - but I am a fan of RPGs and open-world games, and I've played a lot of them. [b]Introduction[/b]Hogwarts Legacy is a love letter to the world of Harry Potter - taking place before Potter's time, the game has you fight against a goblin rebellion by harnessing ancient magic. The nature of this magic isn't clear, but of course, your character is the Chosen One, so...[b]Gameplay[/b]The gameplay is incredibly basic. Spam cast magic, with the occasional switching of spells in order to form impotent combos that don't really do much damage to your enemy. Your character is a Hogwarts student [i]in his fifth year[/i], and yet he is learning the magic of a first year - yet, at the same time, he can learn the unforgiveable curses and use them without punishment or repercussion. Combat is slow and clunky, and there isn't enough variety to really keep me interested. The game is mostly about exploration. Find this, collect that. Hogwarts is filled with secrets to seek and puzzles to solve, but they don't feel organic - rather, they feel as if they were added in order to make the game artificially longer. Movement is really slow, which just makes me less likely to want to collect everything.[b]Environment[/b]This is where the game stands out. As a fan of huge, sprawling maps, Hogwarts itself feels too small for my liking, but the detail that has put into building the castle is phenomenal. Staircases, corridors, towers, and parapets all come together to form a wondrous piece of architecture - and you get to explore it, albeit, feeling less like a Hogwarts student and more like a placeholder for someone more important. Hogsmeade is less beautiful, but still a spectacular sight. [b]Characters[/b]The game is filled with bland NPCs, and the secondary characters are not much better. Dialogue sounds artificial, almost robotic, and before long I was spamming the skip button because of how long the conversations are.[b]Final Thoughts[/b]I cannot recommend Hogwarts Legacy to anyone with an ounce of sanity. The game is clearly unfinished - features promised by the developers - [i]Quidditch, anyone?[/i] - have not been included in the full game, obviously coming as a DLC at some unknown point in the future. The combat is clunky. Exploration seems to be key to the gameplay, but it is so slow. The game itself is optimised poorly. THE GAME IS BORING. Out of my four hours, at least an hour and a half of that was spent in cutscenes, by the way. Please don't buy this game.Oh, and to the reviewer who likened this game to the Witcher 3. Not only is that a grave insult to CDPR, but what kind of drugs were you taking when you wrote your review?",1
HOLY BUGGY MESS BATMAN! looks nice if you stand still other than that bad af. go play persona 5 or some shit,1
"for the record, im not a ""maga bot"" or a member of the german national socialists party or a right wing nut...im just saying...the fact that your character is forced to accept the ""they them"" pronoun without any choice is just ridiculous. keep politics, *left wing*, or right wing...out of my games. and whenever possible, try and stick to facts and logic and not pander to the bullyish cultists over at rainbow corps. just. make. games. its 19th century england really didnt behave like this and a school in that era with a minority of white students?? its just so blatant...as a brownie who went to a school of 1000 white students i didnt care nor did i feel different. today...we are being told the opposite by all the marxist cultists over at rainbow corporation. leave us alone. let games be games.ps: the trans bartender was done in the most lazy way possible lmao. ill let you guys google that one for laughs. even some trans youtubers who arent cultist bots agree incase you needed that validation.ps: the game looks pretty, but the voice acting is awful.",1
"Enjoyed This game a lot, i dreamt of having a game like this when i was younger and it really is a lot of fun. However, my experience was ruined when i found out that my choices didn't matter and that the ''evil'' ending literally makes 0 difference since after picking the ending option it just continued on like what i said and did, Didn't happen. I don't recommend this if you wanted a ''real'' Harry Potter RPG, everything is on rails and what you say doesn't matter. it's like playing fallout 4 with magic sticks. but if you like that kinda game where it's basically just let the game force you on it's set path and enjoy the ride, then go ahead. It is really good overall, but after finishing i feel like my fun was taken a dump on and everything i sat through was a waste of time because it wasn't gonna change anything anyway. ",1
"Meh, Needs co-op.",1
"this game needs a fucking enormous quality of life update. the map is fucking cancer, menu navigation is a fucking mess, why the fuck is setting a way point A on the game pad, why X it makes no fucking sense. the menus you are forced to use the idiotic cursor and you cannot highlight anything in menus, must go through the cursor. this game needs to be fixed. save yourself hours of frustration and disappointment and don't fucking bother with this game.",1
"Woke feast.Honestly, the game is not bad, but the cancel culture forced multiculturalism killed the ambiancy.It's litteraly FORCED on you, wether you like or not, you will hear about it every 5 minutes, it's just propaganda and this should not be tolerated.",1
"Game is cool itself but Optimisation sucks. Frames drop like crazy. I got 3060 with 32 gb ram, and ryzen 7 5800 By default the game set me graphics on medium. Playing on medium (recommend) still gives me frame drops from 75 down to 45- 35 for no reason even in small locations with no npc¡¯s or objects. I set the graphics to low and switched of all the rest. Still the same. I got RDR 2 with graphics set on high and frames are stable 90. RDR has a larger world and better graphics though . I just don¡¯t get it. ",1
the story in late game is surprisingly a disappointment. bad writing indeed.,1
"I was kind of excited to play this, even bought an RTX 3080 which I had been eying for a while to experience it with Ray Tracing on.The game world looks absolutely stunning. especially on Ultra with Raytracing. I get around 60-90fps with a drop here and there to 50 while loading an area. This is on 1440p with DLSS set to quality.  Amazing game world and graphics out of the way, let's talk combat.The combat system is also a highlight of this game, it feels fast paces and intuitive. Bit easy at points once you progress, but fun!So, why the negative recommendation? The game does not feel like an RPG at all... Every single choice you make in the game has literally zero effect on the overall world around you. It feels very much like playing an early 2000 game, with the quests being basic and the dialogue being just plain awful. Honestly, it makes for you to have a complete disconnect from the world and your character. Nothing close to how Skyrim, The Witcher or RDR2 makes you feel a connection to the world.I mean, this is an RPG. World connection and feeling the impact you have on it should be number 1 on the list and it's unfortunate. Meanwhile I'm casting Crucio left and right. Right next to my... Teacher? Feels odd that there's no real dark/light wizard kind of system in place to impact what you do and who you do it with.Either way, 15 year old student mass murdering everyone with the dark arts and still everyone around you celebrating you as a hero! Not my cup of tea.Get it on discount for ~20 euro and it's a fun experience. But I can't recommend it for a full price AA RPG as it is advertised.",1
"RTX3070 32 gb RamGame stutts to 15 fps and never get back to normalI read everywhere I should try fix it myself with some .ini stuff but I thing I cant get over is : Why the fuck I would do that ?     I paid the fucking price for a finished product, years of work, dozen or maybe hundreads of profesionnal people working on it, Do you fucking job and make it playable.",1
needs better optimization,1
It's good fun.It's all pretty mindless.Choices are irrelevant.You have no choice who your friends are or are not.Nothing matters.,1
"The game keeps crashing, even though I am using the recommended settings, and have better PC specs than the game recommends. Wouldn't advise buying the game in it's current state, as re-booting it every 10 minutes gets old quickly.",1
Go through all the grind to get better items buy instead they are worse of than the ones you have.seriously this needs to be fixed,1
"good concept, fun game play, horrible utilization/optimization for PC",1
"Rant below aside. Here is why I negatively reviewed it.This is not a Fable Harry Potter game like the ""Hype"" and information developers talked about, lead people to believe.You are stuck on a path in the story and you cannot deviate from it. There is no dark wizardy. There is just dumb hero has special powers and has to save the day.The story is mid-tier at best. You quickly lose interest 5 hours in when you see the predictability in the plot.A lot of things just don't make sense in the game. This is definitely not ""Student at hogwarts"" simulator by any means. It is very clear that the world around you doesn't react at all to you in terms of choices / actions like going into the dark forest. Teachers are completely oblivious to the kind of wizard you're being and the students in the castle are just there. They exist to provide you a school atmosphere but they are no different than the paintings on the wall.Everything is aesthetics and aesthetics alone. The enemies you fight are the same at level 1 as they are at level 30 so combat gets old really quick.Spells are locked behind side quests and extremely long winded treasure hunting for objects designed to waste your time. This entire game is a time wasting simulator. A lot of forced slow walking, a lot of dialogue that gets dried out because its taking from stories you've heard many times before in other games. ""Go help this person, oh I wonder where the butterflies go, oh you found a chest? So cool, you can keep what's in it, I just wanted to know what was there."" You essentially waste most of your time doing things for people who just wanted to know what was at the end of the rainbow out of curiosity. I feel like this entire game is a troll.Rant Below if you want to laugh.Game robs you of challenging combat if you lose too much. It holds your hand like a little baby with a hidden difficulty tailoring system.Example. Died to 2 spiders 4 times, was having fun, it was my first hard fight in the game. What did Warner Brothers decide was best for me here? They gave me the ability now to 1 shot both spiders and end the encounter in 3 seconds because they didn't want me to get frustrated like a little baby.I'm an adult. F you for doing that #$%! to me. I have since had a bad taste in my mouth continuing your game. I am just trying to blow through all this crap and finish the story.Will not buy another ""Oh don't lose too much and feel bad little baby, we will make the game easier for you now because you died!"" game like this again.Also there is way too many systems in this game to slow you down. A lot of forced slow walking, a lot of spells hidden behind an unnecessary amount of chores to unlock, a lot of unnecessary amount of annoying puzzles with your character constantly blurting out the answer to everything so you don't have to think at all. You just have to do what your hero says and rush through the stupid puzzle to get back on track with the story. A lot of treasure hunting just to be able to unlock the unlock spell, very time consuming and irritating to experience.There is just so many things that treat you like a child and waste your time that build up over time and really rob you of playing the game the way you want to play. You are stuck on this train and you can't do anything to speed it up. The story so far is mid at best. Not at all new or inspiring. I'm at 40 hours now and spend most of my time just petting my animals, tired of going out and doing the main story quest. Not sure if I even want to finish it because something tells me, I can't even get the ending I want since I am forced to be the chosen hero who saves the day.",1
This game is terrible.  It's so boring and tedious- save your money!,1
the game has crashed on me numerous times. I've put in around 4.5 hours into the game and I've now lost my save data as well. I will not be playing the game until the bugs are fixed.,1
Keeps crashing on loading shaders. Can't recommend it until they fix this issue,1
"Steam completely, utterly sucks.It overrode all my saved files and wiped out days worth of play time.I don't know if this was a bug with Hogwarts; or just the fact that Steam is a completely fail service.",1
"Extremely bad optimization. Played with medium settings on a 3070ti and only got 30 fps on average. Sometimes, it even dropped down to 10-20 fps.",1
"I have spent hours trying to get this game to run.  Insane frame rate drops and constant crashes.  I play for about 10-15 minutes at a time before the game crashes because I ""ran out of video memory"".  I have the minimum system requirements so I'm kind of lost at this point.  I can tell it would be a great game to play if the performance issues weren't there.",1
"I really, really tried to love this game, given that Harry Potter is my favourite series.[b]Combat[/b]Good, but uninspired for what it COULD be. The shield-breaking thing is cool, if not canon, so it gets points for that from me. Other than that, it's a lot of the same. [b]Characters:[/b]Here they did really well. They¡¯re loveable, unique and generally quite well-animated. Side quests and collectable lore tidbits don¡¯t really do anyone justice though, or make me think anything different of them, which sucks. They don¡¯t have a role other than to add flavour - and even then, they don¡¯t add any [i]magic[/i] to the game.But that's about where the good ends for me.This game took some of the best elements of Elden Ring and The Witcher 3 - and put the Harry Potter IP on it - then COMPLETELY neglected to flesh any of those elements out and make it a masterpiece. After 8 hours, there is no reason to want to explore, since you know every single thing you COULD encounter, each of which involves the same set of empty mechanics recycled over and over for each point on the map.A lot of the mechanics, spells, and potions are recycled in the most dull ways across the map, and are soulless and meaningless. They're also locked behind story quests - not classes - even though your character is a student.The main story elements that they force you through - they¡¯re all the same, and don¡¯t entice you to use your spells in any meaningful or intelligent way beyond some puzzles.No Quidditch. No Patronuses. No familiars. No classes. - not even a brewing minigame.[b]Hogwarts:[/b]Outside of its beautiful facade, and some really nice background chatter and dialogue, the school is devoid of life or magic. There¡¯s no real reason to return to the castle at all. Learning spells is a quicktime event and the ¡°classes¡± are scripted cutscenes. You¡¯re allowed to just walk or fly off the school grounds whenever you want with no ramifications - there are prefect and teacher patrols in two quests - to teach you disillusionment, and how to sneak, and then never again. The staff don¡¯t patrol here, nor do they chill in their rooms after hours, considering you can just break into them for lore tidbits that, given how uninspired the rest of the game is, I'm not even tempted to read. The Restricted Section isn¡¯t full of forbidden books, it¡¯s just a set of rooms locked behind some bars that you can then access forevermore after the first time. The librarian is nowhere to be seen beyond that first sneak quest, and the caretaker waits in the same spot every day and night so you can collect stuff for his silly side quest. The only reason to return - the ¡°collect-a-thon¡± aspect for the caretaker - is locked behind meaningless side quests, using spells that are useless aside from collecting.[b]Exploration[/b]After about an hour of flying around the open world, I guarantee that you've seen everything there is to see, other than the new scenery in other areas. The same sort of camps, landmarks etc. are recycled constantly, with the same enemies, same spells and potions required, etc. The flying is clunky and unintuitive, even with the best broom in the game. There's no reason to explore unless you want new screensavers - because even when you land, the world has no magic other than the visuals. Also, there's the ability to jump, but there's barely anything you can jump OVER. Would have been better combining it into a vault/dodge mechanic.[b]Spells:[/b] There are only about 20 spells out of the hundreds in-universe, and none of them interact with each other in a meaningful or creative way. The coolest thing you can do is solve puzzles, or juggle enemies in the air with dumb, uninspired combos. You can learn the Unforgivables - but there are no ramifications for being a dark wizard, which directly opposes the universe. Casting them in front of civilians has no ramifications, either.[b]Potions:[/b] Six or so of them. Same as spells, just a simple ¡°collect these ingredients¡± and it¡¯s an uninvolved animation that you have to wait to complete. Not a brewing process, no minigame, nothing. The potions themselves are useless unless it¡¯s for combat and you want to face the same enemies over and over and over again across the map at the Witcher-esque bandit camps. Or on the story, which is boring as shit. [b]Beast Collecting:[/b]I initially wanted to explore so I could tame magical beasts, and again, it¡¯s locked behind half of the really shit story. This could have been amazing. Can you bond with them? Choose your own mount? No. You can sell them, breed them (and then sell them), or harvest their body parts for potions ingredients. For the useless potions. Also, you ¡°tame¡± them by casting spells on them, chasing them down and kidnapping them. And you can¡¯t even tame the one dragon there is. Also with all the collecting you can do - you don¡¯t get a familiar or pet, OR have reason to or means of casting a Patronus.  [b]Room of Requirement:[/b]A cosmetically-customisable room that you spend more time in than your own dormitory. Cool... for a room that you go back to¡¦ to power up your cosmetically-customisable clothing (this would have had more of an impact for me if the game itself was magical enough for me to want to walk slowly through it and explore and be a PART of it, without coming across more of the same thing, everywhere). You can also brew your useless potions here, or grow plants, also just time-locked queueable interactions.[b]Sneaking:[/b] Useless. No prefect patrols, no meaningful ways to use it. Especially in the story. There are some areas where scripted enemies jump out of thin air who are supposedly powerful enough to see through your disillusionment, just so they can say a line that¡¯s barely pertinent to the story and force you into the same uninspired, easy combat anyway. If you wanna avoid anything outside of the story, use your fucking broom. [b]Graphics:[/b]The models and attention to detail graphically are gorgeous. The shaders are pretty terrible, though, and lose a lot of the immersion and magic for me. I run a 3080Ti, and even with Raytracing and max graphics, this is far from the prettiest game I¡¯ve played this generation.This has to be one of the most disappointing games that I've ever played - and I was hyped for NMS on release.",1
"I like the game a lot from the hours I've put into it. Unfortunately I played a total of 15 hours on my first save on February 10th, 2023 and it got deleted, I at first i accidentally pressed the button to delete it, but I recently played for another 8 hours on February 13th, 2023 and the game crashed and my save was deleted again. Would love to be able to play and explore, but its hard to keep playing when everything keeps getting deleted,",1
I want to like this game but the stuttering is so bad in some places that it's unplayable.  I'll definitely change this to a thumbs up when they fix that.,1
Right now it is not worth playing at all too many glitches. wait a year or so and get it for 30$ if they every actually fix the game. I am less then half way through and i just cant sting the bad optimization and frame rate issues anymore. I asked for a refund from WB games because steam will not give me one.,1
"literally unplayable with ""video memory ran out"" crashing my game every 10 minutes",1
"The team behind this game is incredibly talented! Great game!EXCEPT: Holy **** has no one on this team ever played a PC game before? The combat controls for targeting default to Caps Lock to set target. Okay, weird, but I can rebind it to Tab.Second problem - the targeting option I've set Tab to does not toggle through targets; it only selects and de-selects the target.Alright. The solution here isn't obvious, but after a quick Google search I find that the button to change targets on keyboard and mouse is the damn arrow keys? When I'm playing with my left hand on WASD and right on the mouse? Do you want me to sacrifice access to one set of inputs? Or grow a third hand?Fine, I guess I'll rebind one of the ""Select next target"" options to another key. Idk, middle mouse button I guess... But wait! That ""Select next target"" option only goes to the next target *to the right.* End up with the rightmost enemy targeted? Pushing that button again does nothing. You need to also bind the ""Select previous target"" equivalent to toggle an enemy to the left.On controller, you just flick right stick either direction to toggle through them. Easy. On PC, I'm being warned I'm overwriting one of 100 other commands trying to find some logical way to get this to work.Please, devs, I'm begging you: Make a mouse drag function like right stick flick on controller and select the next target in that direction, or make multiple presses of Tab cycle through the targets like 90% of games with a similar lock on system.Other than that, again, great game. Just posted this after a frustrating encounter where I felt like I was fighting the awful PC targeting controls more than the enemies in front of me. I'm swapping back to controller for now.",1
Targeting system is god awful and completely useless. Only targets when it wants to and switches to whoever tf it wants to instead of the direction you are pressing. Wanted to enjoy this game on my couch with a controller but wont be possible with whatever idiot designed the targeting system. I want my $60 back.,1
"Game is fun (to me), will update this to positive when I can get it to not run like dogshit on my PC",1
"Very fun, but unfortunately very buggy, plenty of game breaking and progress blocking bugs make it a bit of a pain to play, and autosaves are unreliable - might be worth waiting for a few new patches before trying to play.Well worth it when its fixed.Example: Hard progress lock during the last transfiguration spell quest that removes the ability to interact with most characters and all quest givers, due to some kind of trigger issue with the library field guide page. All autosaves get automatically overwritten and corrupted so only manual saves can take you back, where you might just encounter the same bug again.",1
"The performance of the game is horrible and i am running on high end hardware.. I have tried all the fixes fro, steam to youtube but in vain because the reason is extremely extremely poor optimisation",1
23 hours into game save gone dont buy,1
"While the concept of the game is good. There is so much running around and 10 hours into the game, I've barely made any progress with the main story. The combat is boring and the graphics aren't great. While it my be a dream game for others, it isn't for me.",1
"great game at 15 fps, only problem is the 15 fps",1
"Game tries to be everything, makes it inconsistent in storytelling and railroads the player. If you wanted to be a Hogwarts student this isn't the game, if you wanted to be a powerful wizard this isn't the game. You're constantly pancaked between being a student subject to your teacher's wrath and killing hordes of evil wizards. This constant flipping makes all characters seem inconsistent and poorly written. Pairing with the fact that even some of the cool sounding quests are ruined by their streamlining. The secret wizard dueling club is just 1v2->1v3->1v4 to winning the tournament! The exploring an old shipwreck to recover someone's family heirloom is swimming out into the water and pressing F over bubbles until you find it. The game's boring, and I don't recommend it at it's current price.",1
"Kinda boring main and side quests, merlin trials and other world activities.Menu is exhausting to navigate with and no stash for items, so you are forced to destroy item if your inventory is full or visit merchant every quest if you like to loot everything on quests.Performance is okay, no major bugs.Pretty much the only thing I liked is graphics.",1
"no first person, and it wont let me tab back in. kinda dissapointed. also it just didnt look that good. it didnt have any of the original music either which was also a let down",1
Runs terribly,1
DRM Denovo eats a lot of FPS in this game. RTX 3060 was barely running it on medium. Why does game publishers choose to punish gamers who actually pay for their games.,1
Great game love it but atm I would not recommend it to anyone. I benchmark the game and it recommends me to run everything at the highest settings possible. Instead I choose to run them at the lowest possible setting and I still constantly get frame drops and stutters.,1
Every time I try to pick up my seeds from Neeps shop the god damn game crashes I wasted a lot of money on this god damn game,1
It crashed 5 times in 35 mins. No thanks.,1
it would be a more enjoyable game if it didnt freeze up every minute,1
Gameplay is great but every couple of hours something will pop up and make you wonder why the devs put stuff in if there were already accusations of Harry Potter series being antisemitic. so yeah makes you feel weird when there is that in your fun game about being a wizard,1
"Horrible performance on hardware that exceeds recommended. Trying hard to push through the game and enjoy the story with stuttering, blurriness and erratic FPS. Not sure why the reviews say ""Very positive"". This game was geared more towards consoles, sadly. Couldn't get my refund approved cause I wasted 6 hours trying to optimize it......Waited a lifetime for this game. Tragic.",1
Too many British people.,1
"Honestly, I'm really disappointed right now because I haven't even been able to make it to character creation yet. Why? CAUSE THE GAME KEEPS CRASHING BEFORE I CAN EVEN MAKE IT THERE. I've tried all sorts of troubleshooting but the game still won't run without kicking me out within a minute of booting up. I'm just down right sad at this point. Hopefully they'll patch this soon because I might end up throwing my computer against the wall at this rate.",1
"I pre-ordered the game. I played for a solid six hours until I couldn't even load into the game. My game keeps crashing every time the game uploads shaders. I have the necessary minimum specs in my PC in order to run this game. I have tried absolutely everything to try to fix it, even uninstalling and reinstalling the game. Until this game gets a patch that fixes these bugs, I do not recommend getting the game.",1
"I have so far loved this game but until its fixed you should avoid it.After 14 hours of gameplay the game went to autosave, triggered a full crash, and on rebooting it deleted all of my saved data. There is no way to recover from this. Not interested in replaying 14 hours of story and dialogue to try and catch back up only to roll the dice on another autosave bug deleting everything",1
"JK Rowling is a transphobia. And she support trans exclusionary radical feminists, that's discrimination against people.The game is fire tho. petable cats pog.",1
Bad graphics,1
I keep getting glitches that set me back hours of gameplay and have tried many solutions to no avail.,1
"Visually, gameplay-wise, and the soundtrack make this game an astonishing experience with every bit of magica that the books and the movies depicted. Storywise however I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that supports any manner of oppresion against our fellow human beings (or the hyphotetical oppresion of sentient, congnitive beings).",1
"The minimal amount of camera options make it nearly unplayable for me. The camera as it is is way too close to the back of the character. And they offer no settings to change this. Otherwise it is a good game so far, but with the terrible camera view I couldn't recommend. Also you can't center the camera behind your character, it's off to the side which is very annoying. Lastly, the map is awful.",1
"If you love the wizarding world, and you've always just wanted to cast spells and just be an OP prodigy, or open world exploring games then buy it... but... not at $100 CAD. It runs more like an unfinished game, and the characters and glitches are the same as if we were back in Witcher 1 (even then that game ran better than this one). The unique engine of a game like this, where specific spells do specific things, and having items interact how they are supposed to when using those spells, is extremely difficult. I commemorate the dev team for this. But games like assassins creed 2 runs better than this does and (even remastered) looks more beautiful. I can run that game on ultra (along with No Mans Sky) but not this game. From a non computer science person, its a good game at a glance. Just... not worth 100$ (though no game should be that much). Take it with a grain of salt.",1
"6/10Lo que comienza como una aventura termina convirtiendose en una tortura. Un rpg con puzzles repetitivos, enemigos que simplemente no son mas fuertes, sino m?s resistentes. Matar a un enemigo niveles arriba que tu no es dificil, pero primero te aburriras de esquivarlo. Muchos de los personajes muestran emociones facilaes, pero apenas terminan de hablar vuelven a su expresion neutral, lo cual le quita algo de emocion. Sin mencionar que muchos tienen voces castrantes y/o estereotipicas.Muchas de las quest son lo que le siguen de aburridas, los personajes son olvidales y/o molestos. Salvo por algunos como Poppy sweeting y Sebastian Sallow.A pesar de que el rendimiento es el esperado para un mundo abierto como lo es este, el mapa a menudo se siente vacio, con espacios muy grandes sin objetivos o cosas que hacer.No mencionemos que terminas tan adentrado en otras quest que te das cuenta que hay cosas que debiste conseguir mil horas antes, pero que el juego decidio que era mejor explicarlas a medio juego.",1
"I have been looking forward to this game and I'm disappointed by how it plays on PC. For those of us who can only play the game on PC and have all the necessary graphics / computer settings, yet it still lags and does work well, is very disappointing. I know there is probably going to be an update soon as I know a lot of other PC users are having issues, but still sucks that we have to wait even longer to play it because of the issues. I rather have had to wait longer to be able to purchase it and have an actual working game. I hope that I can effectively play and enjoy this game soon, otherwise I rather just get my money back...",1
"People only think this game is good because they're used to broken releases, nostalgia, and hope. If you really love fetch quests and hate interesting characters, this is the game for you. My god I just don't care about anything happening in this game after the first hour, they really had me hooked just long enough I couldn't request a refund, then gave me a whole list of fetch quests and busy work with literally nothing I care about. I'm sorry, but if I'm looking at all of my quests and saying to myself ""Why would I want to do this?"" You've made a boring video game. Go buy a gamecube and play that Harry Potter game it was far better and more fun.Fuck games like this and please stop buying them, we are all fools, and WB Games played all of us.",1
"I've never read or watched anything related to Harry Potter, but I understand this delineates the locations.Ambling around the world is a joy when your game doesn't drop to 20 FPS (on an RTX 2080 and 3900X) half of the time. Even -- somehow -- in cutscenes, your game will often fail to run above 20 FPS. I've never seen game performance like this. I can run Rust on max settings on a highly populated server and maintain a constant 80 FPS yet this singleplayer game can't manage a few detailed rooms.The combat is quite simplistic though, in fairness, I've advanced through very little of the story.The constant FPS drops make this game a pain to play. I can't recommend it until an optimisation patch is released.",1
Appears to be a video RAM leak in the PC version which causes crashes. These have gotten more frequent as the game goes on - it is now unplayable. Will update review if this problem ever gets fixed.,1
"fantastic game, but wait until they optimize it before you buy it. i'm well above the minimum requirements and it is actually absolutely unplayable. spent hours today trying to fix fps/stuttering issues and its still unplayable. cannot reccomend it in its current state at all.",1
No multiplayer and no story variation.,1
forced to play as a brit,1
seriously awful,1
"horribly buggy. I have the recommended computer graphics, set everything in settings of the game to low, and my game still crashes",1
"One of the most amazing games I've played, BUT a lot of people including myself encountered game save deletion. It was a real problem until I found a way to recover my 20+ hours of game play. Also since the first patch and update TROLL fights have become non finish-able and passable. Many people including myself have had to deal with the fact that when the last blow on a troll is made the game freezes automatically every time and when your main quest consists of fighting trolls it makes the game pointless and unplayable.Once these two issues are fixed this game could take the mark for best game of 2023 but until that happens this game is a broken un-playable mess.",1
"Let me start off by saying that the game is serviceable and I am a Harry Potter fan. I grew up reading the books, watching the movies, and simping Hermione. The game itself is fine. Its an open world game with decent story and lore. The side quests and what not can be a little lazy in terms of dialogue and purpose but the combat, exploration and content is all here for a triple A release.Now, why i give it a thumbs down. The PC port is bad. framerate issues ABOUND. Audio issues ABOUND. Ive had 2 saves go bad so far and had to backtrack to an old save to get the game to load. Im running a Ryzen 7 and RTX 2060super with an SSD for storage. When the game isnt Jankin its robes all over characters faces, dropping frames forcing me to change back and forth between windowed and windowed fullscreen, i get the normal open world first in a series IP stuff that you see in Rockstar, Bethesda, and CDPR open world games.I can forgive that crap, but the poor performance is caca and needs patched (i will change my review)The combat is a FOOKIN blast!. The story is really neat, the characters are well voiced, and the graphics WHEN THEY WORK are decent for sure. I give the GAME ITSELF a 7.5/10.Performance is a 5/10Graphics are 8/10I hope in the next one they flesh it out more and make the Player a little more nimble. Hes rather stiff and could use some dexterity. also the spells and talents are clunky mechanically and controls can be a little rough in the QoL department. game really doesnt come into its own until about 1/3rd to halway through.I dont regret my purchase though.My advice is wait a few more months and see if they offer continued support and optimization.maybe catch it on a small sale in 6-9 months.",1
"Having trouble getting it to work properly.  My system (PC) is a bit dated, but appears that my graphics card cannot keep up with the program. The characters keep losing the details on their faces and hands.  The program is a memory hog, and keeps stopping even with a low frame rate and low resolution. The story line is OK, but the dialog is stodgy.  I regret to think I need a new computer just to enjoy it.",1
"Hogwarts Legacy? More like, Hogwarts Megapee",1
"""I need to break his connection to those traces of magic.""Hear that repeated 100.000 times and you will understand why this is a negative.They need to add a ""Shut main character the hell up."" Option in the Menu.Devs should read up the definitions of ""open world"" and ""false promises"".I think they were never tought anything about these two alien concepts.",1
"Good game, actually inclusive.  review will stay negative until they add in console exclusive content.  All platforms should get the same version of the game.",1
"Very disappointing. The game doesn't feel immersive at all...I guess I just expected more for a game set in the Harry Potter world. The tutorial took an hour to complete, and was mostly cut scenes. Your character has no backstory...just comes right out of the gate as a hero, killing enemies when you know two spells. You can't interact with many objects or NPC's. It feels like you're just walking to a set point and pressing a button...rinse and repeat. I feel so sad disliking the game. Also, it lags frequently on the PC, even with lowered graphics settings. Very frustrating and annoying to sit through.",1
Really cool that I can't play my game after investing over 4 hours - please fix game breaking bugs like this before releasing to the public. Fun game when I could actually load in.,1
"Until the performance issues are fixed, I cannot recommend the game.That is IF the performance issues will be fixed. It's like Batman: Arkham Knight all over again. Same engine, same ****.Update (2-15-23):The patch didn't fix ****. Performance is still the same...still a stuttering mess. Yes, my system meets the system requirements ... in fact it exceeds the system requirements. My specs are: RTX 3090 Ti, 12700K, and 32 GB of DDR5 RAM. There shouldn't be a ******** problem but there is. Hell, I'd be better off just downloading the Ascendio mod to alleviate the unfortunate performance issues. It is sad that ********** modders have to fix games now. ******** developers are too ********** lazy to fix their own ****.",1
"Crashes every 6 minutes while playing, can't finish a duel because it crashes mid duel, game crashes even faster while idle/afk.

"I hate that this is a really good game, because it has so much morally wrong with it. Not only is there the whole trans thing, where the only trans character is massively tokenized and it funds JK Rowling it also has the protagonist fight the goblins which seems fine at first but there are an uncomfortable amount of similarities between the way Goblins and Jewish people are perceived, and the Goblins are fighting for equal rights",1
Never unlocked the gender swap spell.,1
Sony exclusives. 'Nuff said.,1
I don't like the story or characters. Combat is fun though.,1
"Hours of Fun per Dollar Analysis: Did not meet expectations. The game retails at full price of $60 standard edition. You'd be hard-pressed to get 60 actual in-game, playing hours out of it. And even then, I didn't feel it was worth that much. See below. I'm extremely sad to say that I've had to not recommend this game. As a Harry Potter fanatic, I was absolutely ready to love the hell out of this game more than my firstborn child. Sadly, after my initial hype within the first 10 hours and being ready to write a raving review, I've completely swapped sides.I'm not going to knock the technical issues. I know they'll be fixed relatively quickly, so I'm not going to include those in my list. For reading purposes, I'll just make a list of my dislikes about the game and why I've decided to not recommend it.Cons:- The UI and menus are very bad. It takes forever to unlock more spell sets (toolbars), and when you finally do, you still find yourself needing to open a menu and swap out spells constantly.- The diifficulty, and likewise, the equipment and clothing, is a smokescreen. I started on normal difficulty on one character to start my playthrough. My son also has the game and had started on the hardest setting. I played his game, as he's much further than I am, to test some things. I unequipped everything I could, going down the lowest stats as possible with no traits or upgrades, and found that I still had relatively no issues at all fighting. I'm not a good player as a general rule. The game just isn't actually that difficult in terms of combat and all the systems tied to it. Especially if you use potions, plants, etc. Even with no other buffs included. The spells are arbitrary. They all do relatively similar things by one fashion or another and outside of needing to cast a certain category (yellow, red, purple) in succession, don't have TOO much variation.- Speaking of arbitrary, much of the game is. The story doesn't actually eat up a lot of game time. Even the side quests don't. A lot of it, most in my opinion, is running around the castle or world repeatedly finding a certain type of items or repeatedly solving simple muzzles for...not a lot. The world is relatively linear in general. The quests bring you to most of the world to interact with, and aside from searching for every little chest (whose equipment is almost always worse than yours) or the next field guide page (that after extensively bashing your Revelio spell every 2 seconds because you hear a bell somewhere) only rewards you with [spoiler] appearances for clothing slots [/spoiler].-Exploration becomes rather boring after the first 10 to 15 hours. Everything begins to look and behave the same.-You're a student. And yet every single quest, nearly, is telling you to go out and fight hordes of terrifying creatures and enemies. Yet you'll be in trouble for going to the restricted section of the library. From the teachers who are telling you to go into places like the forbidden forest, or any other manner of dangerous area. Practically nothing of the student life actually exists. You go to your classes once or twice, do no real classwork or minigames or anything there, and that's it. Everything else relative to them is for unlocking things. You're not an actual student there. Not really. And you don't feel like it. You're a ""single player god character"" around a bunch of nobodies. Similar to many other games, but much less immersive.- Things likes potionmaking and growing plants and caring for animals and crafting gear and all the things we saw are bland. They're incredibly unintuitive. Such as brewing one single potion at a time, in one cauldron, for 20 seconds each. You can unlock more cauldron slots (although not many at all) and are still tied to that. There's so much more going on here, but I'll leave it at that for now.- There is no replay value. Like, at all. Nothing changes. Not near enough to put another 30 hours into. - There's no good rpg grind. Your experience is strictly tied to quests and completing challenges (mostly just finding a bunch of stuff or killing X of amount of a certain type of enemy).- There's so much more going on here, but I'll leave it at that for now. It feels like it was supposed to be geared toward younger children and then the development team realized just how big a fanbase of adults and teens were hyped for it and tried to make it something more.Pros: - The game is gorgeous. Like, incredible. I couldn't get enough of just walking around checking everything out and flying around looking at all the things. It was really well done in that regard. I love the aesthetic. - The music is -chef's kiss- Muah! That and the visuals made is so nostalgic for me that I almost gave it a thumbs up just for that. - On the surface, the combat is fun in the beginning. It trails off after.- The voice acting was really well done, I thought.- I haven't encountered any large actual bugs or glitches other than a chest that didn't open and sometimes people's robes or capes getting screwy. Nothing game-breaking.- Initially getting sorted and getting your wand and all felt incredible. It felt like I was really, finally going to Hogwarts. It doesn't last and the game steps on its own feet thereafter, but that initial first 8 to 10 hours, ugh.... More of that, please.I could keep going and nit-picking every aspect, as I'm sure others have mentioned plenty of other large or larger issues with the game overall, but this is enough. I hope that they build much more onto this base game. I really do. My heart needs that to happen.",1
"Sure the animation was great, and the tutorial was... decent, so to speak. I liked the story at the beginning, but I didn't like the dialog. It had that ""you're the chosen one! You are bound to solve *everything*!"" Which for me, not my style or go to. If you want a reference for the style, MMO RPG, like Star Wars: The Old Republic. Right after the tutorial, the animation quality dropped, and so did my urge to want to continue. I'm not the kind of person to hear the ""It gets better (X amount of hours) in, when you become really powerful."" Granted, I was never one to like Harry Potter, but I liked magic. Take that how you wish, and don't take my opinion to heart for if you want to try the game or not.",1
"not as long as jkr gets any profit, but we dont talk about how you avoid that :)",1
Had to refund. game crashes way too much and I see a lot of people having the same performance issues with high end setups,1
Tr*ns bar keeper and the game trys to make you befriend a swarthoid,1
I think this game was way overhyped. It just feels very hollow compared to other very good open world games. I recommend waiting for a sale,1
Good game poor performance and the bartender in hogsmeade is awful,1
They make it too easy to accidentally delete your character. 13 hours down the drain. Won't be starting over.,1
"The game is fun, but runs like garbage to the point of taking away from the experience. Took hours of googling and trouble shooting to get it to play without game breaking lag and stuttering. And now it just crashed on me because the 10gb of ram it was using wasn't enough and it turns out the autosave feature is broken so I've lost 3 hours of game play.",1
"As of this point, no matter how much I want to like this game, I have had to restart my playthrough TWICE and lost several hours of gameplay due to the current bug involved with saves deleting themselves. I paid $70 for this?",1
"The game is sub-par at best, the story was boring, alot of busy work just to keep up with the levels, Graphics were ok except for the consent frame drops, characters including ur own uninteresting.",1
"Popular grumpiness aside, and focusing on just this game. The opening bit seemed ok with no problems and pretty decent animation and graphics, but things went horribly wrong once you got to Hogwarts. That was when EVERYBODY's face turned to immobile melted wax with creepy empty eyes the stuff of nightmares. It also has a fun bug that does weird things to your hands when you put on gloves.... because you have no hands.  I have a computer that plays No Man's Sky, Cyberpunk 2077 and the latest Jedi games with no issues. so it seems unlikely yo be a hardware issue.  This is just too disturbing to play like this.   OK, they immediately put out a patch. The other people's faces look slightly more like faces even if tehy are still frozen. The main character is still creepy wax with vacant eye sockets. and he still doesn't have hands, even though he is wearing gloves. The gloves just seem to hover at the end of his arms and occasionallt wiggle about.",1
"No quidditch, absolute scam",1
"I just finished the game after +50 hours and here is my thoughts:The game is well designed in the sense that the environment looks amazing. However, I was expecting this game to be a more ""choose your own story"" adventure game.I would've preferred if you started from year 1 in Hogwarts and could make something of yourself i.e, becoming a dark wizard or going into the ministry or stay as professor at Hogwarts, your choice of ending. But this provides none of that. Instead, you are thrown into a set linear story path that you cannot divert from. I dont get the experience of studying in a school, but only playing a normal Open World game with magic school as the background. There is no routine in this school, you dont take class unless the quest asks you to; you only sleep on the floor when waiting for someone; you dont eat food; you dont actually make friends at your own will (collect different teammates will be so much fun); there is no actual difference or competition between colleges.so much more could have been done. I am just disappointed.The main draw of the game, Hogwarts, is both a blessing and a curse. The animations of the stairs building, ghosts popping in and out, and the joyful music playing are probably the best parts of the game. That's all there is to it however, It just looks good. You cannot interact with any of the students The only option is to walk around, observe, and eat an apple.The only other game I played set in an environment like this was Bully, and that game offered way more freedom than the developers here have allowed. It's hard to immerse yourself when you're pretty much watching a movie about your character, rather than actually playing as them.and side quests is just... look like they here by forcethey were so casual, like ""go collect ..."" or ""go find ..."" etc.and the fun thing is, the game has only 26 spells. Yes, you reading that right, only 26 and you can only equip 4  spells at the same timethe animations is great, i cant deny that ... the way of dangling the wand, the shape of the cape, the magic ... they looks amazing. but when looking at a game like elden ring who has 150 spells, and the game isnt only a wizard game...they could have been so much more doneskyrim even has speels than over +150, and just like elden ring, that game has much more than just magic.i dont really know if my expectations were high about this game but ..im about to tell you much more bad sides of the game1) Boring premise of the main story - yet another ""you're a wizard"" moment where you're that rare kid with super powers that very few others have. I wish it was more grounded with you being a regular student who got him/herself into trouble with friends and now are trying to solve things you may have ruined to begin with.2) ""Loading doors"" (one of the most annoying problems)  I can't enter a different location for a few seconds as the location itself is being loaded and thus the door won't open right away.3) Cutscenes. Feels very rushed. Some cutscenes are short, some characters reply without any expression or care. Classes last for a few minutes and it's always you doing things. Learn a spell. Click click. Voila, class is over lads. It feels that devs put a lot of effort in re-creating the environment and then they were told: ""Yo, you have 1 month to release the game"".4) Population - while the game has day/night cycle, I don't see students & teachers going to their beds in the evening. Location ""despawns"" populus behind your back. You can be semi-afk staring at a beautiful painting playing a nice melody and suddenly, location is empty because its night. You look around once more, its full again as its morning. But you don't see them coming downstairs or upstairs, they just appear. Its this odd feeling when world is sort of alive but it isnt. Feels more like a checkbox to me at times.and agin im going to say ;Words can't describe how disappointed I am in this game. This was advertised as ""make your own path"" kind of game, yet it can't be further away from the truth. There is one path, and it's the one the game gives you. There is no becoming a death-eater, or a being universal... you're just the character the game tells you to be.The whole game is lifeless, NPCs don't react to anything you do, you can talk to some of them but that's it. You can go around casting spells, no one will even look at you or react the slightest. You can go and enter people's house after forcing their locks, go through their chests, they won't say or do a thing, they just act like you're not even there.Most of the time you can't jump to places, invisible walls everywhere, making exploration very linear and flavorless. Combat is fun, but I'm still looking for difficulty. Basically entered one of the most dangerous places, the Forbidden Forest, after 2 hours playing and defeated everything that came my way without breaking a sweat, there is no real danger or even sense of danger, and of course you can't attack centors, because yeah... you're not a bad person, so the game won't let you do bad things.You can fly on a broom, and again, no sensation or feeling of speed, you can go into an obstacle at full speed and you will just stop, no impact, no animation, nothing. You just stop like it's okay to ram into a wall.The only decent thing about the game so far is the story. It's well designed, for now, but there is not much choices or decisions to take, and the only few really don't change anything to the story... you just go with it and follow the game's lead. It's basically a playable cinematic.one more thing about the quests:An adult woman, about in her 30s-to-40s from the looks of it, is asking the main character to ¡°follow the butterflies¡± into the Forbidden Forest, because she¡¯s interested where they lead and is herself scared of going into the Forest because¡¦ of her Hogwarts background. The teachers told her that Forbidden Forest is off limits to students because there is a lot of dangerous stuff there that will get her killed as students are not yet prepared to deal with it.Let me emphasize. A grown woman who studied at Hogwarts and knows for a fact that entering the forest is forbidden to students and is scared to go there because she doesn¡¯t want to get killed by dangerous stuff out there¡¦ asks a Hogwarts student to go into Forbidden Forest. Not because she¡¯s desperate, not because this is a matter of life and death to her¡¦ but because she is curious where the butterflies fly off to. Unbelievable.She¡¯s not the only one who will ask the main character, a Hogwarts student, to do stuff that is in direct violation of Hogwarts rules in a way that doesn¡¯t even imply that it would be breaking the rules. Quests like that are everywhere in the game.The characters will ask you, a Hogwarts student, to kill deadly Acromatulas, collect stuff in the Forbidden Forest or take on a camp full of dark wizards without even remembering that they are talking to a student. Even teachers will do that. But then when we need to go to the restricted section of the Library, suddenly the rules are in place again and you have to sneak around the librarian lest she tells on you to the headmaster.I just returned from butchering an entire village worth of dark wizards and I¡¯m being threatened to be told on to the headmaster?i will re-play the game all over agin and hope at least some of the mechanics will change.. (probably it will not but i'll give it a shot.)",1
"First of all, steam only lets you give a yes or no answer to whether you recommend this game, so this review isn't entirely negative. Ill start off with what I liked:- The open world is very well crafted, it's not big but they make it feel big which you can go out an explore from the start. - The story is ok, but nothing special. - The combat is fun and relatively well designed. - The puzzles aren't too repetitive and are pretty interesting, reminding me a bit of GOW. Now the negatives, and oh boy there's a lot:- Frankly this game is way over hyped, yes it exceeded expectations but only because they were low to begin with. - The quests aren't really quests but feel more like tedious errands you have to do for people in order to progress through the game. This was one of the most awful aspects for me, and really tested my patience. Things like ""go use a mandrake root on some enemies"" only so you can run back to an npc to get the new spell wingardium leviosa, even though there's seemingly no reason why you had to do these chores in the first place. Every side quest is more of chore you have to do for someone, like go find an item at x and bring it back to a and then go and find another item etc. Even the classes feel tedious and boring, because i know ill have to do one of these stupid assignments after every one of them. In other games, they would fit more into optional challenges players can do to earn achievements or filler, but here they form the bulk of the content. 10 hours in, i was tired and desperately hoping that if I progress far enough something interesting will happen. - None of the npc content was intriguing to me at all, and they are usually very shallow. For example, there's a part when you have to answer trivia about the wizarding world and one of the questions was 'what are the deathly hallows', and one of the options was horcruxes. I chose this option because I thought it would be interesting to see the npc's react to you knowing about horcruxes, which from the book were supposedly a big no go topic, but the npcs have absolutely no reaction and just say oops you're wrong. Why add horcruxes as an option and then completely ignore an opportunity to show interesting canon reactions, like i may as well have said slugs. This brings me to the next part:- If you actually want to role play as a dark wizard the game will not let you. Yes, you can use the unforgivable curses but they're locked behind a side quest that will literally take you to the end of the story by the time you can use spells like avada kedavra. Funnily enough though, this side quest had more character development than the main story. The spells are treated pretty much like every other spell anyway, there's barely any response from npc's and will react pretty much the same as every other spell you use. I used crucio on someone next to the damn professor and he didn't care or react at all. - In terms of dialogue, it's like your character is constantly high or something because he's always smiling and never really reacts angry, scared or anxious no matter the situation. I liked a few npcs but most were pretty much the same in that regard. It takes a lot out of the experience because the story tries to make you feel like it's important, but then the characters react like its another Tuesday. - There isn't really any grind or reward for gear like other rpgs, it's simply finding gear in some random chest and then equipping whatever gives you better stats.- Most of the open world side content is filler. Go clear camps to get runes to apply to your gear, over and over again. It seems they locked your inventory capacity just so they could fill more content, so you have to run around doing 'merlin trials' just so you can increase inventory slots, which makes no sense when they give you a bottomless bag to put animals in. - Getting new spells would feel rewarding if you weren't fighting the same enemies you were in the first hour of the game at the end of the game. Overall, it's a game i'd buy after playing every other good rpg out there and was bored looking for something to play. I wouldn't even say it follows canon that well. Don't buy it thinking you're getting something as detailed as RD2, GOW or Elden Ring, but it's by no means a terrible game and I can appreciated the effort the devs put into making it.",1
Unplayable with frame drops. Do not recommend on PC.,1
"I WANT to like this game. I REALLY want to like this game. I pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition because I was really excited for a quality HP game that I could put some time into. Optimization aside, which definitely is a problem on PC, I just can't can't recommend the game at this price point. I'm almost 30 hours in and I just don't care about the character or the story at all. I keep hoping something is going to grab a hold of me, but instead I just keep slogging along. I think one of the other reviewers really summed the game up when they say that it's a lot less of a Harry Potter RPG where you're immersed in Hogwarts, and a lot more of a game where Hogwarts is just a backdrop. You're not a student at Hogwarts. There are no routines. You don't have to go to class unless you want to. You can walk through the great hall while people are eating, but that's all it is, a backdrop. You can go to your dorm, but you don't sleep there. No one cares if you're out of bed at night. No one cares if/when you head off to Hogsmead. Do you want to go hang out in the restricted section of the library at midnight? Go ahead. No one cares. I understand that it's an open-world game, but I feel like they could have done a much better job of finding a balance between being open-world and actually being a student at Hogwarts. I think that is the fundamental reason I just can't get invested in the game or the main character.I own and play a lot of escape rooms, and this game is like a bad escape room where everything is RELATED to the theme, but none of it makes any logical sense.The game DOES do a great job with the setting. It looks great. There's lots to explore. The music is subtle most times, but effective. There ARE some iconic characters in the game, and iconic locations. Easter eggs galore for fans of the game, but the marketing claim of making you feel like a student at Hogwarts is so, so off base.",1
"boring, fell asleep half the times i played about 45 mins in... slow....a lot of dialogue , fighting is basic, very linear story and play",1
"Wizards can be Witches and, Witches can be wizards..[spoiler]Also don't let the bartenders voice fool you..he's a dude and admits it midway through the campaign.[/spoiler] Game would be perfect if the developers didn't cater to the woke crowd, destroys the immersion. Going to wait for mods, assuming they don't get Spiderbanned first. I'm all about you-do-you and play as you like, but give an option to have that content enabled or not.",1

AS IF folks. 32gb MIN! MINIMUM!very God of war / assasins creed fluidity and mashability, combat system is wayy easier than advertised. all the enemies are the same, the camps are all the same, the attacks are al lthe sameits super easy to over level in the game, they almost force it.theres no shortage of side quests, but theyre all the same - go there do a thing, go back rinse repeat. nothing custom or original.you cant pick your own path either, theres no light wizard or dar kwizard etc. theres no karmma system, you have limited responses to each character and no definitive pathway in magic. just a student forced on a potteresc type mission.door puzzles are fun, the magic spells are meh, theres no scaling system for the spells,youre only allowed the spells they preload, theres no independent learning.the ""open world"" is only so open, its nothing like a GTA, skyrim,assasins creed, its open world in the same way spiderman remastered is openworldthe MAJORITY of character creation profiles cater to ethnic ""minorities"" and females. very limited options and changes for ""white"" males. you can create your character anyway you want, to include tone of the voice, and if your voice is MALE OR FEMALE. the game is full of woke divieristy, and characters who dont belong and arent period correct to 1800s england.the female students are always flirting with your character, and the occasional male vendor will drop subliminal flirtatious openings to you when leaving.1. Fetch Quest extravaganza - 0 innovation in quest design reminds me of 2005 quests in the early AC games.2. Enemy diversity and quality , there is none. Like 5 enemies in the entire game and they all have the exact same attack patterns and abilities.3. AI this is hugely problematic because combat although flashy is a total bore fest, scroll wheel between slots press cds , rinse repeat, use some semblance of order and the game is a not only the easiest RPG i have quite literally ever played, but its messy and clunky, control wise too.4. Fast Travel is needed because the map is bloated in size to fill it full of pointless markers just to fill the dead empty space they should have just deleted.5. Traversal, the broom and mounts are too slow and clunky , once you can fast travel...why bother with them except for the boring fly through ballons or minigame races.6. puzzles amount to pushing, pulling and throwing or smashing objects, welcome to zelda except you do it for a little thing to pop out the ground for reasons.7. The gear system feels like a 'spreadsheet player engagement driven corporate"" mechanic that is obtuse and stupid. It also feels unfinished and is flawed in many ways. Boring sad progression limited to 3 stats and some terrible overly annoying traits to obtain that its not even worth the time.8. the spell list is tiny and uninspired and makes the game feel really poor compared to something like elden ring that gets magic right. The talent system feels unfinished and cookie cutter.9. voice over. Nope.10. lack of any dynamic worlds events or anything happening in the world. Its extremely static , to the point that it feels like an empty tech demo at times.11. The lack of wider more robust systems like crime, morality, and npc interactions turn the static npcs into essentially mannequins with no purpose.",1
very boring if you aren't that interested in the Harry Potter series. i tried but eh,1
"Dogshit game, poorly optimised, cant run above fucking ultra graphic settings or game looks like it was made in 2002 for the PS1, fucking glad to be refunding it",1
zzzz,1
"Despite enjoying the game, the performance issues are too much. If they ever actually fix them, I'll revisit this review, but for right now, I can't recommend it.",1
Original movies didn't have WOKE crap in them.. such a disappointment to see woke crap in here.,1
So far 5 hours into the game the directions are not clear and getting stuck in forced Fast Travel when literally nothing is working. Either I have a bug or the game isn't direct.,1
I have tried everything to get this game to work and my PC just ain't having it. I can't even get the game to launch. I blame JK Rowling at this point.,1
The quest: crossed wands is the worst fucking quest in the game...... Its 2v4 and your partner doesn't even do anything. And sometimes the enemies TELEPORT behind you. Also the lag is so bad and the lock on enemies is even worse. I lock onto a guy and I shoot at someone totally different.,1
J.K Rowley sucks zoo wee mama,1
Still waiting for day one patch. This game stutters like crazy and suffers from pretty bad performance issues.,1
Game runs like a turd on fire,1
"This is NOT an Open-World RPG, this is an Open-World Action Adventure game and its a stark difference. If you don't mind the focus being combat and exploration, then this game is for you. But if you were hoping for a Harry Potter Fallout 4 or Skyrim, then this is not the game for you.",1
"honestly, its a bad open-world rpg takes some of the worst aspects of owrpg and pastes them all over this game. If it wasn't for the Harry Potter IP i would have refunded this also L JK Rowling",1
Game constantly crashes,1
22 hours down the drain because of some bug with saved games. Nothing online works. Looks like im done playing this game unfortunately they already have my money.,1
deleted my fucking character because the settings button is the same as the delete character button. ffs. 10 hrs wasted because of shitty UI design fuck you.,1
"Game breaking bug that destroyed my save 10 hours into the game. Have tried all the online guides, can't restore old game.Not willing to play the game until I see that a fix is in place. The first 10 hours are not enjoyable enough to be willing to play through them again.",1
Better than expected! But bad optimization.,0

7/10 - my immersion is somewhat broken by the fact that 18th century Scotland school has 90% of the professors and more than half of the students with foreign accent. How many are there in the movies? And that's 20th century,0
After a long time I've spent so much time on a Single-Player Game. I am seriously hooked on it. I am looking forward to further content for this game.,0
it looks amazing,0
"I love this game, despite completing the story there is tons more to do :) Secretly hoping that, at a later date, there will be further progression where you becoming a working member of the ministry with new stories/missions :)",0

awesome game 10/10,0
HOGWARTS + RPG = EXCELLENT,0
"there were major performance issues to start with, but they seem to have been mostly fixed. Overall a great AAA game!",0
Game is a blast whether you liked HP or not. Choice is an illusion as all outcomes are predetermined and the story isn't spectacular but the other aspects of the game more than make up for it. Solid 9/10,0

Amazing game. Can spend hours in it.,0
The amount of effort and dedication the developers put into this game is astounding. This is the definition of what the gaming community needs. Games you can play over and over again... NOT the same game you can purchase over and over again.,0
game is a lot of fun best i played in a while,0
So magical,0

Im a wizard. I was not expecting the game to be this well put together. I never was a fan of the Harry Potter franchise but this is just a good game,0
Yes but not optimized very well (in terms of memory and lag) great gameplay tho,0
This may be the next skyrim-tier open world. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this game was far better than any notions or nay-saying done before the release. One of my favorite games since Elden Ring. 10/10 very good outside of the token trans npc.,0
Is fun and has a Victorian vibe to it. my wife loves harry potter books and stuff,0

I downloaded Hogwarts legacy on valentines eve prepared to spend the night all by my self. But at the first herbology I saw her! Professor Garlic. now I have spent days writing romantic poems and sending them to the greenhouse. Best game ever 10/10,0
Hands down the Greatest Game I've had the pleasure of playing.  Do yourself a favor and upgrade your computer and get an HDR10 monitor to enjoy it to the fullest.  If you have any stuttering issues most likely you have 16GB RAM and need to upgrade to 32GB+,0
One of the best drops in years,0
